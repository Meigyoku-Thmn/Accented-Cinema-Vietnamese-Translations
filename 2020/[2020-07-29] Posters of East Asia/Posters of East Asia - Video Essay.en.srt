00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,680
A while ago

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,420
A poster went around Reddit

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,920
And got a bit of attention

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,460
I was surprised that

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,440
A friend of mine instantly recognized it as Chinese

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,760
With the use of white, negative space

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,352
It's only then, I realized that

8
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,600
Different countries approach posters very differently

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,440
I never realized that

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,780
Because good posters are often underappreciated

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,680
We don't tend to notice the good ones

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,560
It's usually the bad ones that catch our eye

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,380
So today, let me purge my ignorance

14
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,400
And explore the world of Asian movie posters

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,920
Posters from China, Japan, and South Korea

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,480
Let's see what each country's general design trend is

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,660
And highlight a few posters that I personally love

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,860
Keep in mind that I'm not a graphic designer

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,540
I only made a few posters for my own films

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,700
So take my opinions with a grain of salt

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,780
I'll stick to mostly recent films

22
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,870
Since there really isn't much to talk about

23
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,120
With regards to the infamous "Photoshop" age

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,040
Everyone suffered back then

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,560
Like, why is this guy transparent...?

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,360
So, let's give them the admiration

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,140
They rightly deserve

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,500
If you look up Chinese posters on Google

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,120
You'd find a lot of cases of plagiarism

30
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,040
Unlike Japan and Korea

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,579
The Chinese film market really only became big

32
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,280
In the past decade or so

33
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,620
The market has yet to value posters as an
art form

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,040
As with any starting player

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,820
With no budget

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,160
And even less time

37
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,940
The best an overworked, underpaid graphic designer can muster

38
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,580
Is to copy someone

39
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,040
Who best to copy

40
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,740
Than the biggest player in the world, Hollywood?

41
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,460
The only problem

42
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,560
Is that Hollywood blockbuster posters in general suck pretty hard

43
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,220
They are notoriously unimaginative

44
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
As a result

45
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,460
Many Chinese posters end up feeling

46
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,859
Both cheap and uninspired

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,420
Wandering Earth's main poster is atrocious

48
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,149
I hate posters where characters just stand there

49
00:02:11,149 --> 00:02:12,140
Doing nothing

50
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,940
It's just an illustrated list of actors

51
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,720
And a badly photoshopped one at that

52
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,160
But its scenic posters are pretty amazing

53
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,900
After all, the actors in the film arenâ€™t the draw

54
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,840
It is the world-building

55
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,660
But my favorite is this one

56
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,962
In which it captures the main selling point of the film

57
00:02:31,962 --> 00:02:35,320
Being an adaptation of the Chinese Sci-Fi classic

58
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,440
Look at those old and worn out pages

59
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,740
Stabled together

60
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,930
Capturing that post-apocalyptic feel of the film

61
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,560
Where society is barely functional

62
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:49,420
But my favorite is how it illustrates the story

63
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,860
The story of Earth leaving the solar system behind

64
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,380
On this image, every planet is listed

65
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,600
Except for Earth

66
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,960
Intriguingly missing, leaving an empty spot

67
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,720
That's a sick concept if you ask me

68
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,800
Much like this poster

69
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,840
When Chinese posters get good

70
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,800
They get REALLY good

71
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,400
Most of the best Chinese posters out there

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,040
Are all design by one man and his company

73
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,320
Huang Hai

74
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,200
Their posters are beautifully poetic

75
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,900
And very visually striking

76
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,340
The Golden Era tells the story of a woman activist and novelist

77
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,780
Living in wartime China

78
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,160
The tilt-shift effect and the high angle shot

79
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,740
Looks down onto her, as if she's a miniature model

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,840
The seemingly random splashes of ink

81
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,080
Paints the big world she's living in

82
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,879
Signifying the chaotic time the film is set in

83
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,340
And signifies how much influence her, as a writer

84
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,720
Has on the world

85
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,080
Oh, and the international poster is also really good

86
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,860
My favorite Huang Hai poster has to be Masters in Forbidden City

87
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,460
It's a film about museum workers

88
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,220
Repairing and restoring historical relics

89
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,040
The poster relies almost solely on the beauty of these artifacts

90
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,700
What makes this poster special

91
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,520
Is here

92
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,420
This is what Chinese people describe as

93
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,180
"Drawing the eye of the dragon"

94
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,320
Giving life to an art piece

95
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,220
The shape of this worker is tiny

96
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,340
Insignificant

97
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,520
While the relic is immense

98
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,840
It captures the feeling of restoration perfectly

99
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,670
It is a delicate and tedious task

100
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:35,260
It takes sometimes years just to repair one relic

101
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,440
Yet it also captures that feeling of history

102
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,640
A moment in time

103
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,856
As the tagline suggests

104
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,140
Big history, Small craftsmen

105
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,080
Of course, Huang Hai isn't the only one who makes good posters

106
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,440
Brotherhood of Blades 2 is visually beautiful

107
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,180
But what's interesting is how small the actress is

108
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,160
Yang Mi is a very high profile star in Mainland China

109
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,740
And is absolutely someone to draw in more box office revenue

110
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,040
The decision to leave her so tiny is bold, to say the least

111
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,040
But it works

112
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,480
The beautiful composition draws you in

113
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,680
The empty space leaving you wanting for more

114
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,300
So you read the text

115
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,030
That's how you find out who she is

116
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,380
And once you went through this process

117
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,480
You are not forgetting this poster ever again

118
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,900
Many Chinese animations also have great posters

119
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,540
I'm guessing it's because the studio already knows how to draw

120
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,800
Big Fish and Begonia's poster is just...

121
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,520
Wow

122
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,900
But its quaint character posters are also really beautiful

123
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,560
Makes me wish the entire film looks like this instead

124
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,080
White Snake has a spectacular hand-drawn poster

125
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,900
Even if it doesn't really reflect the film's art style

126
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,520
Its international poster however

127
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,680
Is next level

128
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,860
White Snake is a story about seeing humanities in monsters

129
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,370
The eye of a snake monster seeing its past memories

130
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,740
And tearing up

131
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,240
Is the perfect visual summary

132
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,100
In recent years

133
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,780
Great posters became a hot topic in China

134
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,060
More and more people are paying attention to this art form

135
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,090
If these beautiful posters for Ghibli movie re-release are any indication

136
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,938
The Chinese poster industry

137
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,960
Is going to be something very special

138
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,020
Now let's travel to Japan

139
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,793
In terms of general design trend

140
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,280
Japanese live-action films love this manga panel design

141
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,970
It's hard to make screengrabs look good in posters

142
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,520
As it tends to look flat, busy, and out of place

143
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,486
But Japanese poster designs mastered it

144
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:50,620
And it is very recognizably Japanese

145
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,940
You rarely see other countries do this

146
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,580
More often than not, I find it to be very pleasing

147
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,600
Even if it's very overused

148
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,820
Still, Japan is not immune to Mount Rushmore posters

149
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,800
At its best, you have this

150
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,160
Which is aesthetically pleasing

151
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,140
But otherwise lacking in metaphor

152
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,740
At least I don't see it

153
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,500
At worse, you have this

154
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,020
I don't know why

155
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,840
Anime and manga adaptations tend to come with

156
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,240
The worse posters

157
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,440
This is worse than Wandering Earth

158
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,820
It does have one exception:

159
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,780
The poster for Death Note focuses on the two main characters

160
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,900
Or rather, the pitch-perfect recreation of them

161
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,180
As if reassuring the audience

162
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,680
That this is more than a cosplay

163
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,900
But the one I like is the one featuring Light

164
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,240
Backlit

165
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,900
Dark clothes on dark background

166
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,260
It's sinister

167
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,900
But the real highlight is the apple

168
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,620
The symbol of sin

169
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,040
Is it floating?

170
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,480
Or is it falling?

171
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:55,580
Or is it holding up by an invisible being

172
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,303
In this composition

173
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:59,740
Your eyes jump between Light's face

174
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,780
His hand

175
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,820
And the apple

176
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,380
The ambiguity is intriguing

177
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,420
But also symbolizes Light as a character

178
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
Perfectly

179
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,063
Still, my favorite live-action Japanese poster

180
00:08:12,063 --> 00:08:13,460
Has to be this one

181
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,860
Instead of going for movements like most posters

182
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,360
This film goes for stillness

183
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,400
With the two birds resting on the hilt of a sword

184
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,320
It feels both calming

185
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,820
And foreboding

186
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,400
Makes even more sense when you realize

187
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,760
The film features a blind swordsman

188
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,220
But really

189
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,180
When it comes to Japanese cinema

190
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,860
Animated movies are the current king

191
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,159
Your Name's poster is all-around well done

192
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,539
Low Angle to show off the beautiful sky

193
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:45,460
Something that Makoto Shinkai is known for

194
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,900
Image splits in half while remaining connected

195
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,280
Reflecting on the film's parallel storylines

196
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,500
What I'm always amazed by, however

197
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,920
Is the text layout

198
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,820
Japanese posters almost always have this uncanny ability

199
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,500
To make a wall of text look clean

200
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,660
Here's the English version for comparison

201
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,020
The poster for The Journalist took it to the extreme

202
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,503
As the title suggests

203
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:14,450
It's a film about investigative journalism

204
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,260
It cleverly uses the text in the format of a newspaper

205
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,720
To tell you the title

206
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,340
The hook

207
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,940
The list of actors

208
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,040
And the time it'll be in theatres

209
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,120
All while using the gaps to highlight the two characters

210
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,120
Of course, there are also split panels down the bottom

211
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,560
It is a Japanese film after all

212
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Back to Anime

213
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,040
Hello World is a film about preserving old culture

214
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,660
Through the use of technology

215
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,888
The upper, technology-themed part of the image

216
00:09:41,888 --> 00:09:45,400
Is mirrored in the bottom half with nature and older architecture

217
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,160
Representing the struggle between the two

218
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,340
At the bottom, two characters hold hands

219
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,500
Showing the true message of the film

220
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,560
That the connection of human heart is the key

221
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,560
The poster for A Silent Voice doesn't seem very special

222
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,960
Outside of its fantastic art style

223
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,140
But it does have one neat thing

224
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,480
And it's pretty obvious when you see it

225
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,618
Shoko, the girl here

226
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:12,760
Is the only one who's not facing left

227
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,740
She's almost, but not quite looking at the camera

228
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,557
In fact, she's looking at nothing

229
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,800
She's in her little own world

230
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,380
In the film, Shoko is deaf

231
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,020
And this poster, through one image

232
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,380
Captures her emotional isolation from other people

233
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,380
And then, there is Tokyo Godfathers

234
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,820
Characters stacking on top of chaotically arranged skyscrapers

235
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,170
Representing their frantic journey through  Tokyo

236
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,066
But did you notice that everything is arranged

237
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,600
In the shape of a Christmas tree

238
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,120
Finally, there is Paprika

239
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,680
A film about dreams

240
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,820
And just like its premise

241
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,330
The poster is visually crazy

242
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,120
If not a bit seductive

243
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,580
The poster overlays this madness of dreams

244
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,600
Onto the body of the main character

245
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,220
In the style similar to traditional Japanese
tattoo

246
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,020
Like every dream has an effect on your body

247
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,180
Imprinting itself onto your identity

248
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,800
I, however, prefer the DVD cover

249
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,920
The close up of the face covered in madness

250
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,020
With the eyes standing out

251
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,460
Highlighted by the shape of the hair

252
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,580
You can't help but stare at it

253
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,640
When your eyes meet

254
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,000
It draws you in

255
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,100
And now

256
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,280
You are in her mind

257
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,500
In her dreams

258
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,820
Mesmerizing

259
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,960
I know I said I don't like Mount Rushmore posters

260
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,780
But man, the South Korean film industry sure makes it work

261
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,420
Faces are the main trend of recent Korean movie posters

262
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,600
But it's not just faces on posters

263
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,300
There's always something interesting going on

264
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,860
And you can usually guess the theme or plot of the movie

265
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,020
Oldboy has this uneven close up versus medium split

266
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,890
They feel conflicting, contrasting

267
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,680
Yet because of the size differences

268
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,200
They feel distant

269
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,940
Like they are plotting something against each other

270
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,120
What a way to show conflicts

271
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,959
Forgotten is the total opposite

272
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,920
It nearly perfectly matches the two faces

273
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,220
Making it uncomfortable to look at

274
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,939
Just like the poster

275
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,880
The movie is a total mindf*ck

276
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,120
Dealing with multiple identities of multiple people

277
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,640
All entangled into one unifying conspiracy

278
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,920
Monster took a familiar big head poster concept

279
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,760
And throws a twist into it

280
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,000
The two heads along with the striking arm and claw

281
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,540
Creates a triangle for your eyes to wander back and forth

282
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,376
With a title like this

283
00:12:46,376 --> 00:12:47,800
It just makes you wonder

284
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,320
WHO is the monster?

285
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,580
The girl who's holding him by the neck?

286
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,920
Or the man who's smirking while all this is happening?

287
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,620
Now that's not saying there aren't generic big head posters

288
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,940
But even when they are generic

289
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,380
There's usually a strong composition

290
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,320
To prevent it from being bad

291
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,500
Some times, movies would take the big head concept

292
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,920
And use it on medium or wide shots

293
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:12,800
People just stand there

294
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,640
Graduation photo style

295
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,160
And just like their big head counterpart

296
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,380
The good ones always have a twist

297
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,760
One of the most memorable ones

298
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,900
Is A Tale of Two Sisters

299
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,460
What a poster

300
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,140
The image splits into two parts

301
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,660
With the parents dressed in black on top

302
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,480
Mirrored by the two sisters dressed in white

303
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,920
The immediate interest is the blood all over the two

304
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,340
But did you noticed the two sisters

305
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,480
Are in very similar gestures to their parents?

306
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,180
One with her back straight

307
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,260
The other with one hand to the side?

308
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,120
But instead of confident and assertive

309
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,720
The sisters look weak and lifeless

310
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,660
As if they are puppets of their parents

311
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,300
Of course, who can forget about Parasite

312
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,940
Which has this poster

313
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,680
The feet at the bottom

314
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,120
Is, of course, the biggest interest point

315
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,380
It also puts the entire image off balance

316
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,140
Giving it a twisted feel that matches with the film itself

317
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,140
But the group itself is also intriguing

318
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,060
It contains two families

319
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,113
One rich, one poor

320
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,720
How can you tell?

321
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,260
Well, the poor family members aren't wearing shoes

322
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,160
Overall, Korean posters appear to be the most consistent

323
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,680
Among the three countries, we discussed today

324
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,309
Although at times

325
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:34,270
It does get pretty samey

326
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,320
But rarely is a poster downright bad

327
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,480
That speaks to the overall robustness

328
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,160
Of South Korean cinema

329
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,580
Respect

330
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,100
If there's ever a picture that worths a thousand words

331
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,839
That picture would've been a poster

332
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,749
Condensing an entire script

333
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:55,589
Distilling an entire movie

334
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:57,720
Down to one single frame

335
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,720
That is an art

336
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,160
I took the liberty to redesign the poster for Pure Hearts

337
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,860
See how it changes your expectation

338
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,940
And the perception of the film?

339
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,380
I bet at this moment

340
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,206
Every single one of you still remembers most posters

341
00:15:13,206 --> 00:15:14,660
Shown in this video

342
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,660
And many of you became curious about the movies

343
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,120
Simply because of the posters I showed

344
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,020
That's the power of a good poster

345
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,500
Next time

346
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,180
When you walk past one

347
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,700
Give it a closer look

348
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,080
On that image

349
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,360
Are details, crafted by artists
