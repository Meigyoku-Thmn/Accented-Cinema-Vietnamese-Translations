3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,860
"But when two hares running side by side"
"How can you tell the female from male"

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,360
It's nearly impossible for me to express

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,640
Just how important the character of Mulan is to me

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,820
And to every single Chinese person

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,460
The Ballad of Mulan is taught in elementary school

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,340
It's one of my favorite poem from China

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,120
And at one point in time

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,000
I could recite the entire poem by heart

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,440
There are opera plays

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,060
There are TV shows

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,580
Countless books for children and adults

14
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,900
I can't think of any other traditional characters

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,760
Who is this ubiquitous within a culture

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,540
It was the 90s

17
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,090
Mainland China started importing Disney animated films

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,480
Not long after I watched the Lion King

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,380
I heard stories of Disney making a Mulan film

20
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,360
Chinese animation was pretty much in the gutter back then

21
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,780
I was excited to see Mulan as a cartoon character

22
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,060
Spring of 1999

23
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,300
Our elementary school trip brought us to the local cinema

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,540
To see Mulan

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,880
I figured it's probably just a 1960s adaptation or something

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,580
To my surprise

27
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,720
A Disney logo appears on the big screen

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,160
Every kid in the theatre gasped

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,800
We were ecstatic

30
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,680
And it was every bit as beautiful as I have hoped

31
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,440
It's not a perfect film

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,300
It has some questionable racial depictions

33
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,840
Although I guess the Huns aren't around anymore?

34
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,560
And I heard people say it's a watered-down version of the story

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,640
Then again, Chinese people love to say that to everything

36
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,780
None of the matters

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,175
Because for the first time, I feel represented in a cartoon

38
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,260
My culture, my favorite story, on the big screen

39
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,880
And I'm just a dude

40
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,940
I can't imagine how powerful it must have felt to a young girl

41
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,040
Mulan is unlike any other Disney female lead at the time

42
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,600
Arguably, ever

43
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,780
She's not born royalty nor nobility

44
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,306
And does not marry into one either

45
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,420
She's a warrior

46
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,880
With a kill count of thousands

47
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,020
For a traditionally highly patriarchal country

48
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,460
Mulan is an important icon

49
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:37,500
Who not only gives girls in China an important representation

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,600
But a sense of empowerment

51
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,626
When Mulan defeats Shan Yu atop the palace

52
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:45,200
The entire theatre of children cheered

53
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,300
Clearly, the film did something special

54
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,607
Fast forward 20 years later

55
00:02:51,607 --> 00:02:54,580
A new, live-action Disney Mulan came out

56
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,180
And it came at the perfect time

57
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,180
Feminism is, once again, a hot topic in China

58
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,060
News of domestic violence

59
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,020
And gender discrimination came into focus more and more

60
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,180
Preference for sons over daughters is still a big issue

61
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,689
Those were empowered by Mulan during their youth

62
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:16,140
Are currently fighting for their equality

63
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,900
It is the perfect time for a new generation of Mulan

64
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,400
To inspire people

65
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,300
And you Fxxked it up!

66
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,040
To understand how the live-action Mulan fails

67
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,340
We need to see where the 1998 Mulan succeeds

68
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,300
The story of Mulan is set in a nonspecific era in ancient China

69
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,190
A time when the greatest honor a woman can bring

70
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,180
Is to get married and bear children

71
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,600
Which Mulan is terrible at

72
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,280
"Put it out!

73
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,260
Put it out!

74
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,220
Put it out!!"

75
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,220
During this time, the Huns begin to attack China

76
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,520
To counter the offensive, China conscripts one son from each family

77
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,240
"The Fa family"

78
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,460
"No!"

79
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,260
Having no sons in the house

80
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,960
Mulan's father is the only one who can go

81
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,581
Too wrapped up in the social order

82
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,600
Mulan's father refuses to consider otherwise

83
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,540
"I know my place!"

84
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,979
"It is time you learn yours"

85
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,280
And with his age, he will surely die on the battlefield

86
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,760
To save him, Mulan decides to dress up as a man

87
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,020
And join the army

88
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,740
Mulan's journey empowers women in two ways

89
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,280
First, by showing her capability in holding her own against men

90
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,320
Mulan starts off as a total amateur

91
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,360
But so does everyone else

92
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,120
We see this ragtag group of soldiers train

93
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,517
And in any and all relevant aspect

94
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,580
Mulan can keep up with men

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,580
As the other soldiers grow

96
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,780
So does she

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,960
Here, the film made a statement that

98
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,480
Women, in any practical situation

99
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,580
Can be just as capable as any other man

100
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,280
Mulan learns to be masculine

101
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,420
"And this... represents Strength"

102
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,340
She is capable of harnessing strength and power

103
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,940
Traits that, traditionally, are valued by men

104
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,540
But what's more interesting, is the second way the film empowers women

105
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,400
By empowering femininity

106
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,500
Now, this sounds strange because at first
glance

107
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,380
Mulan isn't very feminine

108
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,220
she is a tomboy and a failed bride

109
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,960
"You may look like a bride"

110
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,920
"But you will never bring your family honor"

111
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,840
But she's also not good at masculinity

112
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,200
Being extremely awkward at pretending to be a man

113
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,073
That's because those are the extreme versions of gender expression

114
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:58,290
Femininity means submission

115
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,900
Masculinity means aggression

116
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,140
In a sense, Mulan's journey is to embrace her own gender expression

117
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,820
She succeeds in doing traditionally masculine tasks

118
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,340
By refusing to engage in hypermasculinity

119
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,660
Rejecting the values of brute strength

120
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,420
Instead, she's able to overcome her challenge by using clever solutions

121
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,920
On multiple occasions

122
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,120
And her friends learn from her, too

123
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,680
They start off as hyper angry hyper-masculine men

124
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,340
But by the end, are willing to be in drag

125
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,900
To save the emperor

126
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,260
We see both sides learn to embrace each other

127
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,540
Girls can be manly

128
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,460
And that men being girly, is not necessarily a bad thing

129
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,740
There is strength on both sides

130
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,660
And there is strength in not limiting one with either extreme

131
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,220
Finally, it's important to realize the climax is her trying to save the emperor

132
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,700
And not China

133
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,653
It has probably an unintentional moral

134
00:06:56,653 --> 00:07:00,660
That Mulan's power, and by extension, a woman's power

135
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,200
Is best used to uphold the patriarchy

136
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,280
The storytellers at Disney probably took notice, too

137
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,300
And to avoid that connotation

138
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,110
The film cleverly suggests that

139
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,140
Mulan doesn't save the emperor out of loyalty

140
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,660
She merely sees the emperor as a fellow human in need of help

141
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,647
But more importantly

142
00:07:20,647 --> 00:07:22,260
After the dust settles

143
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,680
The emperor offers Mulan a position in his counsel

144
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,960
"You can have his job"

145
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,840
Mulan declines

146
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,180
Rejecting the value in upholding the patriarchy

147
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,275
She returns home, to the only patriarch she recognizes

148
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:38,550
Her father

149
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,740
She presents him the sword and a medal

150
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,560
Bringing symbolic honors to her family

151
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
What does the father do

152
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,140
He tosses everything aside and embraces his daughter

153
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,919
"The greatest gift and hornor"

154
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,540
"Is having you for a daughter"

155
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,360
Breaking the final patriarchal relationship

156
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,140
Their love is a human one

157
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,300
Instead of a dragon

158
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,760
Mulan 2020 has a no name phoenix that does nothing

159
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,300
And the CGI looks like utter crap

160
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,789
Maybe it wouldn't be a problem

161
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:19,180
If the animators joined Skillshare

180
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,940
Anyway, Mulan 2020 follows largely the same basic plot

181
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,176
Mulan fails to be a bride

182
00:09:15,176 --> 00:09:16,880
China summons its troops

183
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,597
Father too old to fight

184
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,920
Mulan leaves in her father's place

185
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,460
But with a few critical differences

186
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,231
Difference number one

187
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,100
Mulan is now a naturally gifted fighter

188
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,420
That is such an awful decision

189
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,810
Instead of seeing Mulan growing alongside her friends

190
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,060
Letting us know that women are as capable as men

191
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,560
Now, only the select few who are blessed by the gods

192
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,160
Have the privilege of catching up with men

193
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,040
Those who aren't so gifted?

194
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,240
Like Mulan's unnecessary sister character?

195
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,520
Well, she gets married at the end of the film

196
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,920
"I'm matched"

197
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,220
Imagine you are a young girl

198
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,080
With confidence issues

199
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,600
You watched Mulan 2020

200
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,910
Then you go back to school

201
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,620
And see other girls who are prettier than you

202
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,560
Who are better at sports than you

203
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,480
Instead of saying you are just as capable with enough perseverance

204
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,040
No, they are Mulan

205
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,800
And you are just the sister now

206
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,380
Sorry, not everyone is special

207
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,840
Difference number two

208
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,980
In the animation, Mulan is a problem solver

209
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,690
Mulan finds her way to the top using her wit

210
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,200
Instead brute strength

211
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,860
And, I have to emphasize this

212
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,000
She's the ONLY ONE to make it

213
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,560
Mulan is able to solve this problem

214
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,820
Because she can think outside the box

215
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,520
Without indulging in hypermasculinity

216
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,980
Where strength and brute force are valued

217
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,760
In context, the hypermasculine ideal of strength

218
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,460
Is and will always be only achievable by the few

219
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,640
Not everyone will make it

220
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,180
Mulan's success is a statement

221
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,300
That there is value outside of the hypermasculine way of thinking

222
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,260
The live-action version of this scene

223
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,540
Has Mulan climbing the mountain with two buckets of water

224
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,980
How does she solve this problem?

225
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,220
Mulan simply does the manly thing better than men

226
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,800
Through sheer strength and will power

227
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:13,055
To hammer this home further

228
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:15,900
Mulan kills the villain by using his weapon

229
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,340
A weapon traditionally associated with men

230
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,020
On the surface, it appears progressive

231
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,360
That man and woman are not so different

232
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,600
But when carefully examined

233
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,360
It is indulging in the traditional masculine value of strength

234
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,600
And that a woman is good

235
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,640
Only if she can man up

236
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,340
Mulan's experience and perspective as a woman is not valued

237
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,170
If anything, her gender is a hindrance

238
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,460
So instead of her teaching her friends to break free from hypermasculinity

239
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,780
She... just doesn't

240
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,680
The only lesson she learns in the film

241
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,260
Is to not hide her true identity

242
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,300
And her naturally gifted power

243
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,180
"Then, you'll die pretending to be something
you are not"

244
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,840
Bitch! she has to hide her gender to save her family

245
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,400
The two themes don't go well together!

246
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,900
But what angers me the most

247
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,180
Is the third critical difference

248
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,160
The reason Mulan wants to save the Emperor

249
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,180
"I know my place"

250
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,800
"And it is my duty"

251
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,000
"To fight for the kingdom"

252
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,160
"And protect the emperor"

253
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,040
"I know my place"

254
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,580
"It is time you learn yours"

255
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,720
Look at her submissiveness standing next to the emperor

256
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,480
Her fight is literally to uphold the conservative hierarchy

257
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,216
Because in her story

258
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,400
She's treated fine as a woman

259
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,620
Or at least so she thinks

260
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,400
"You'd believe Hua Jun"

261
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,120
"Why do you not believe Hua Mulan"

262
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,580
This conservative value of "loyalty" and "honor"

263
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,120
Is something that the people of China have abandoned and detest

264
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,060
Ever since the collapse of the feudal system

265
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,600
We have a word for that!

266
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
"What is this fourth virtue I see?"

267
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,460
"Read it aloud, Mulan"

268
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,120
"Devotion to family"

269
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,520
It's called yū fǔ!

270
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,080
Mulan doesn't challenge the status quo

271
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,220
"You can still take the noble path"

272
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,780
She IS the status quo

273
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,440
Perpetuating the notion that

274
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,180
Just because one supernaturally gifted woman is respected

275
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,020
Then all women are respected

276
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,220
Gender equality achieved

277
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,120
Like the animated film

278
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,760
Mulan returns home to meet her father

279
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,740
And that emotional moment

280
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,280
Where the father abandons his symbol of honor, is gone

281
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,080
Instead, their reunion is short and bland

282
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,340
That's because their reunion is not the final ending

283
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,601
Next, the emperor sends a gift to Mulan

284
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:59,480
A sword, symbolic of her bringing honor to her family

285
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,220
This reward is played up much bigger

286
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,260
Than her lesson about being who she is

287
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,260
Or loving who she loves

288
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,780
And once again, she's invited to work for the emperor

289
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,580
"To join our greatest decorated warriors"

290
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,130
"As an officer and the emperor's guard"

291
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,700
Does she accept the job?

292
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,420
The film ends before she gives an answer

293
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,209
But with her smile

294
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:23,560
The answer is probably yes

295
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,340
What a load of bullsh*t

296
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,160
Now, the perceptive among you are probably already reading deep into this

297
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,080
And think there are all kinds of Chinese propaganda in this film

298
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,649
Which, I don't really want to get into

299
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,720
Because I don't think that's the case

300
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,350
That would be giving this movie too much credit

301
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,639
Mulan 2020 isn’t malicious, it’s just stupid

302
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,540
And it doesn't give a flying fxxk

303
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,060
It only wants to appear diverse and inclusive

304
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,780
It has four writers

305
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,300
Not one of them is Asian

306
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,980
Let alone Chinese

307
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,580
Its dialogue sounds like a white person's oriental fetish

308
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,960
"I told you you cannot eat, it'll ruin your make up!"

309
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,660
"The fiercest winter storm cannot destroy this make up"

310
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,000
It only wants to appear emotional

311
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,800
Mulan fails to be a bride?

312
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,640
No singing reflection

313
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,620
No contemplating her failure

314
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,840
No father-daughter bonding moment

315
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,160
The moment she steps out of the classroom

316
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,640
The minister is already there summoning the men to war

317
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,380
When Mulan leaves

318
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,880
This is how Mulan's father reacts in the animation

319
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,880
This is how Mulan's father reacts in live-action

320
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,280
It only wants to appear empowering

321
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,020
Through the laziest ways

322
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:45,820
Mulan is just naturally better than anyone

323
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,019
Only some girls are special

324
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:50,605
The not-so-special girls should be happy

325
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:53,320
Being fitted into traditional gender roles

326
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,540
Get married and bear a child

327
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,660
"I'm matched!"

328
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,360
And finally, it only wants to appear Chinese

329
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,960
It makes no attempt at understand or deconstruct Chinese culture

330
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,580
It mixes up the Chinese Phoenix myth with the Egyptian myth

331
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,220
"Some say the Phoenix is consumed by flame"

332
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,620
It sings praises to a western understanding of Chinese conservative value

333
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,226
Failing to realize many of these values

334
00:16:19,226 --> 00:16:22,089
Have since been abandoned by Chinese people

335
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:25,740
It just wants to LOOK Chinese enough to fool the audience

336
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,560
And the sad thing is

337
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,320
It's probably going to work

338
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,780
As I said, China needs Mulan right now

339
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,420
Instead, all we got is a big-budget virtue signaling

340
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,520
Nothing signals that more than this moment

341
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,820
"Black wind and I rode along side two rabbits running side by side"

342
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,410
"I think one was a male, one was a female"

343
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,630
Mulan's dialogue here is a reference to the Ballad of Mulan

344
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,899
It takes one of the most iconic and powerful lines from the poem

345
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:02,720
And turns it into a throwaway fan service moment

346
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,099
In the Ballad

347
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:07,739
Mulan went to war for an astonishing ten years

348
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,819
And was promoted by twelve ranks

349
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,599
No one ever found out she was a woman

350
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,659
She was that much of a badass

351
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:19,760
In the poem, she also rejects a governing position

352
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,920
And chooses to return home

353
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,299
It was only when her fellow soldiers come to visit

354
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,800
And see her, in a dress, wearing make-up

355
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,320
Do they realize the truth

356
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,760
Confounded, they ask her why they never realized she's a girl

357
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,420
To which, Mulan replies

358
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,460
"The male hare’s feet go hop and skip"

359
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,760
"The female hare’s eyes are muddled and fuddled"

360
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,200
"But when two hares running side by side"

361
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,200
"How can you tell the female from male"

362
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,282
Mulan's answer was poignant

363
00:17:52,282 --> 00:17:55,200
Men and women may look different

364
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,520
But when living amongst each other

365
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,160
When fighting beside each other

366
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,460
What difference do the differences make?
