1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,820
It can be intimidating to take your first step into foreign cinema

2
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,280
Language barriers

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,260
And cultural barriers

4
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,840
But if you are a cinephile

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,480
You probably knows more about Asian cinema than you think

6
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,680
Because a lot of your favorite Hollywood movies...

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,960
have elements inspired by Eastern culture

8
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,580
Some more obvious and others

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,300
Here is an ode to Asian culture in Western made movies

10
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,820
"I know Kung-fu"

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,920
Well, you are in the wrong place for that.

12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,620
Anyway, I want to talk about THIS

13
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,080
You may already know about wire-fu

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,960
a technique originated in Hong Kong

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,220
It's basically actors being pulled by invisible wires

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,540
Popularized by The Matrix in the West

17
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,080
it has since been used in many Hollywood movies

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,900
What you may not know is that this visual has more cultural significance than just flying

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,420
How'd you do that?

20
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,240
The air

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,680
You can't see it but it feels your lungs

22
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,840
You treat the air the same way

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,820
You step on it as you with a stone

24
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,360
You swim through it as you with the sea

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,540
And all you have to do is believe

26
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,320
It's called "qing gong",

27
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,560
Literally means the technique to be light

28
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,560
It's a martial technique for scaling obstacles

29
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,100
And in Chinese martial art novels

30
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,680
This technique has been greatly exaggerated

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
to a point where characters can jump on water

32
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,880
or even control their own body weight

33
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,260
Explanations for this technique differs

34
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,960
One version says these martial artists can control an unseen life force called "qi"

35
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Qi...

36
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,820
Internal energy

37
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,580
The essence of life

38
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,320
By manipulating this force in and around them

39
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,840
the martial artists can be lighter than air

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,100
and gracefully float around like dragonflies

41
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,500
After the release of The Matrix

42
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,080
the visual of Qing Gong continues to evolve

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,920
The film you are watching here is called Hero

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,080
Director Zhang Yimou takes inspirations from religious wall paintings

45
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,880
his characters in Hero fly and glide like the gods and goddesses of China

46
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,940
If you are fan of The Matrix for its kick-ass action

47
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,780
and philosophical stories

48
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,120
Then maybe you should give Hero a watch

49
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,280
"The force is what gives a Jedi his power"

50
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,720
"It's an energy field created by all living things"

51
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,280
"It surrounds us and penetrates us"

52
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,480
"It binds the galaxy together"

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,900
Didn't we just talk about this?

54
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,480
It's no secret the Star Wars takes a lot of inspiration from Asian culture

55
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,900
the force is pretty much just qi

56
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,940
Instead of lifting a user,  it lifts other things

57
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,940
And the lightsaber...

58
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,060
Katana in space

59
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,280
The connections between Star Wars and Eastern culture are numerous

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,820
From the visual design

61
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,400
To the fighting

62
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,160
To the philosophy behind the iconic weapon

63
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,500
"This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight"

64
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,860
In Chinese culture swords are considered a gentlemen's weapon

65
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,000
"An elegant weapon from the more civilized days"

66
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,060
Because it demands skill rather than strength

67
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,900
"That lightsaber was Luke's and his father's before him"

68
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,200
"and now it calls to you"

69
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,100
Recognizing the owner by the sword

70
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:24,200
And the one swing one kill fighting also draws parallel with katana combat

71
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,920
After Star Wars and Kurosawa

72
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,040
Japanese sword movies continue to evolve

73
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,800
One of my favorite, surprisingly, is an adaptation to manga

74
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Rurouni Kenshin

75
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,400
It's a film about reformed assassin with a sword that doesn't kill

76
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,140
who must find his own way to protect the people around him

77
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,400
If you want some amazing sword fights

78
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,160
Or are into the mystics of swords

79
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,880
Rurouni Kenshin comes highly recommended

80
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,900
See the similarity?

81
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,060
This is called "battojutsu"

82
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,240
The sword drawing technique

83
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,400
Basically quick draw for swords

84
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,980
The origin of the technique is convoluted

85
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,180
One version says it was technique used by samurai to counter assassination attempts

86
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,760
That's not to say Western quick-draw is inspired by battojutsu

87
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,180
Here's Shane doing it, before Kurosawa

88
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,960
But with Kurosawa's love for western movies

89
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,440
And Sergio Leone's love for Kurosawa

90
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,000
it's safe to say these two genres influenced each other

91
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,700
and the parallels are uncanny

92
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,180
The intense stares

93
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,740
The fast and accurate kills

94
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,040
And of course... putting a weapon back

95
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,300
Much like qing gong

96
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,400
the art of battojutsu gets more exaggerated over time

97
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,160
In popular media, you can often see the objects being cut remains one piece

98
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
until the sword is put away

99
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:02,660
As if reality is too slow for the swordsman

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,920
The film you're watching right now is called Zatoichi

101
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,740
It's one of the longest-running film series ever

102
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,620
And it's still going on to this day

103
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,680
The titular blind swordsman was THE folk hero in the mind of a generation

104
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,820
Much like the Clint Eastwood cowboy

105
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,920
If you want to  see some good action in a western-style folktale

106
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,220
Zatoichi is a great choice

107
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,920
I suggest the 17th entry: Zatoichi Challenged

108
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,100
Anyway, this is called "dim mak"

109
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,680
Not that one

110
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,840
Remember the concept of qi?

111
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,640
In Chinese fiction, by interrupting the flow of qi in someone

112
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,880
You can paralyze them

113
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,200
and it can be done with finger injecting qi as well

114
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,380
You can also reverse it by restoring the flow

115
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,640
It's acupuncture, but with the force

116
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,780
The extreme version of it can cause someone to die

117
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,400
and is referred to as death touch

118
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,500
The "five point palm exploding heart technique" from Kill Bill

119
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,600
originated from a movie that features the original Pai Mei

120
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,640
But not used by Pai Mei

121
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,220
At least not in the original Chinese version

122
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,240
In Clan of the White Lotus, the technique is called "hundred steps soul reaping palm"

123
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,360
And it's used by Bak Nin, who belongs to the same clan as Pai Mei

124
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,600
When struck by this technique the victim dies within 100 steps

125
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,900
due to the qi being shut down

126
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,440
In recent years though

127
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,380
with Chinese audience wanting more realism in movies

128
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,700
Dim Mak no longer shows up in movies as often

129
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,240
and if it does, it's for comedic effect

130
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But if you don't mind your classic style martial flicks with some comedy in it

131
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,080
Fong Sai-yuk I and II are two movies to watch out for

132
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,720
Featuring the titular folk hero of China, played by Jet Li

133
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,160
It's an amazing blend of old-school action from the Shaw brothers era

134
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,340
and the more up-to-date story and visual of the Jackie Chan era

135
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,560
So that is some of the gateway films for you to get into Asian cinema

136
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,900
And some background explanations to help you understand them better

137
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,400
But if you've still find these concepts overwhelming

138
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,780
Well, maybe let yourself get confused

139
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,460
It's like going on a vacation

140
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,920
Where's the fun, if you already know everything about it?
