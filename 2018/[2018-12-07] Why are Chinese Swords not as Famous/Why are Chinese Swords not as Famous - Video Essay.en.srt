00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,180
Have you ever wondered why is Chinese or not as famous as Japanese sword?

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,880
Almost everyone knows the word "katana"

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,400
But I bet not a lot of people know the
Chinese word for sword

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,400
to be honest I don't really know the reason why

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,520
China doesn't lack any fancy blades fictional or otherwise

6
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,040
So this video will just be an educated guess

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,720
A sneak peek in the philosophy of swords in China

8
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,280
And how swords are depicted on the silver screen

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,120
spoiler alert: I don't think China care much about swords

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,800
First let's set the stage

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,600
Sword myths similar to Excalibur and muramasa are not uncommon in China

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,640
The legendary swordsmith Gan Jiang and
Mo Ye is fairly well-known to the Chinese

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,119
In this legend the couple were
forced by an oppressive King in China

14
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,020
...to forge a sword

15
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,360
After the sword was finished

16
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,880
The king executed Gan Jiang, the husband

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,080
So that no more swords in the future can rival that of his

18
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,120
Still, another sword was forged in secret

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,880
The wife, Mo Ye, fled along with the sword and her unborn child

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,920
Hoping, one day, the son may seek vengeance against the king

21
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
It's a fairly standard legend about swords

22
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,320
the cinephiles among you may also remember the Green Destiny

23
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,840
In the film, it's often referred to as the sword of Li Mu Bai

24
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,030
Indeed, Chinese sword culture is not that different from that of Japanese

25
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:51,780
We both have the concept in which a sword is part of a person's identity

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,160
And we can recognize a person by the
sword

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,960
But there is a slight difference

28
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,080
In the scene from the Japanese film, Rurouni Kenshin 2

29
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,960
The villain explains that when two swordsman are equally skilled

30
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,920
Their weapons make the difference

31
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,960
The hero lost, because his sword is weaker

32
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,840
And as he puts it, the sword is his oath and faith

33
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,920
It symbolizes how his ideology is challenged

34
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,800
At the end, the hero wins the rematch by
finding a stronger sword

35
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,120
and having a stronger faith in the path he chose

36
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,720
Now, in the case of Green Destiny

37
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,880
The sword is indestructible, it can cut through other weapons with ease

38
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,240
But at the end, the weapons hardly matters

39
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,120
Fighting with a rusty sword

40
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,000
Fighting while grinding the sword

41
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,080
Winning a sword fight with a stick

42
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,960
In Chinese storytelling, a swordsman's skill is is often far more important than the weapon

43
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,200
in a Chinese novel "The Return of the Condor Heroes"

44
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,200
The strongest character, whom we only know by name and never actually met

45
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:23,320
...had reached a level so high, that he ended up using everyday objects as his weapon of choice

46
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,680
I believe this has something to do with kung fu and his focus in strengthen the body and mind

47
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,120
Over the utility of fighting and killing

48
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,240
In a sense, weapons are just someone's garment

49
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,280
You can recognize someone through it

50
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,360
but at the end, it's just a sharp piece of metal

51
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,600
it may also have something to do with Japanese Shinto beliefs

52
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,920
... that everyday things also have spirits within

53
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,400
In Japanese culture, swords may be sentient

54
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,880
but in Chinese Buddhist culture, however

55
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,760
Everything is an illusion

56
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,720
Ascending above material objects is a sign of enlightenment

57
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,280
Hence, the stick thing

58
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,720
Ultimately though, I don't think Chinese people care about swords  as much as other cultures

59
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,920
In the final battle of Jet Li's "Fearless"

60
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,280
The protagonist fights a Japanese martial
artist with weapons of their choosing

61
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,960
the Japanese martial artists, unsurprisingly, goes with a katana

62
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,720
The Chinese hero goes for a three-sectioned nunchuck

63
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,360
Which is technically a whip

64
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
The most recognizable Chinese weapon to the Chinese

65
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,800
... is probably Guandao

66
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,480
...a weapon of the Chinese god of war with

67
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,920
With the concept of "Eighteen Arms of Wushu" deeply rooted in Chinese culture

68
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,360
I think Chinese cinema simply prefers diversity

69
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,280
Swords

70
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,260
Spears

71
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,760
Paper Fans

72
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,760
Flying Guillotines

73
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,220
Threading needles

74
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,280
And Whatever Jackie Chan wants to use

75
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,720
Now, this is interesting...

76
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,520
No?
