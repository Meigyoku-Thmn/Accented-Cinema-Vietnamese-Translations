1
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,820
So I was watching Wolf warrior

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,560
A 2015 Chinese blockbuster

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,120
And I saw this

4
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,920
It's a deeply patriotic battle cry

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,000
Like one of those you saw in Independence Day

6
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,340
But instead of feeling proud as the Chinese

7
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,340
My feeling was mixed

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,480
But then I realized this is not a speech to raise morale

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,480
This is a warning

10
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,660
Directly to the rest of the world

11
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,580
My earliest exposure to Chinese patriotism was in elementary school trip to the cinema

12
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,960
The films were always educational to some degree

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,220
Which is why I never understood why we watched Drunken Mmaster II

14
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,500
It's a 1994 Hong Kong classic

15
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,760
It tells the fictionalized story of a Chinese folk hero

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,700
Called Wong Fei-hung

17
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,560
In the film he's a young martial artists who uses skill to fight injustice

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,140
But he's playful attitude tends to cause more trouble

19
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,640
It was a good time like most Jackie Chan movies

20
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,720
But at the time, I was too young to fully understand the message behind it

21
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,420
You see, Imperial China was once a victim of colonial exploits

22
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,400
To oversimplify things, in the mid-1800s late Qing Dynasty

23
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,600
British merchants smuggle large amount Opium's in the China for sale

24
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,580
...in exchange for highly demanded items like silks and Chinese tea

25
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,760
This created a generation of drug addicts in China

26
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,200
The increasingly worsened relationship between the Qing government and the British merchants

27
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,000
...escalated into the opium war

28
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,220
Which the British won

29
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,460
And Hong Kong became a British colony

30
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,140
From that point on many Western countries also exploited China

31
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,940
More and more Chinese territories were at "leased" to Western powers

32
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,019
as well as blatant robbery

33
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,699
...like the burning of the old Summer Palace

34
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,560
And there's also Japanese invasion in World War II

35
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,620
To this day, you can see the scars of colonialism in many Chinese cities

36
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,740
It's not rare to see old western building clusters

37
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,860
standing in a middle of a Chinese city

38
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,260
This is why Chinese patriotic films have foreign bad guys

39
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,600
In Classics like Drunken Master II

40
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,060
The message is revolving around a core Chinese values

41
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,140
To never forget the shame of the nation

42
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,120
And to endlessly improve ourselves

43
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,880
In the film, the protagonist represented the self-perceiving image of a pre-colonial China

44
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,740
He is strong, but he is immature

45
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,740
He's good at heart, but he causes trouble

46
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,100
He has great power, but he abuses it

47
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,500
But when faced with a national crisis

48
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,740
He learns and uses power for what really matters

49
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,160
This is where wolf warrior steps in

50
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,120
the film features a renegade hero who causes trouble

51
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,660
just like Jackie Chan

52
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,740
He is the best of the best, just like Jackie Chan

53
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,600
And he also faces a national crisis

54
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,880
Which he has to use his power to solve

55
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,260
But it's not being punished for the mayhem he caused...

56
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,140
His renegade actions always save the day

57
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,040
At the end, he is always right

58
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,900
There's nothing for this surrogate of China to learn, to improve

59
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,420
Going back to Drunken Master again

60
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,300
The main villain of the film is the European business tycoon

61
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,920
He is well-dressed, well-spoken

62
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,740
A larger-than-life existence

63
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,700
In wolf warrior our main [villain] is visualized with shots like this

64
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,500
It's grotesque, making the villain appear as a clown

65
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,520
You know what I fight for?

66
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,750
Money

67
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,080
So not only does our hero learn nothing

68
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,240
He has no need to

69
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,780
By having the bad guy portrayed as less than human

70
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,760
It removed the motivation for self-improvement

71
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,480
This is why the line sound is so wrong to me

72
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,580
It's not a message to the Chinese people

73
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,800
It's warning the rest of the world.

74
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,920
It doesn't help improve the nation

75
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,000
It just boast the strength of China

76
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,840
Something this film does plenty of

77
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,200
With economic upturn

78
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,100
it seems China is finally stepping out of the trauma of the past century

79
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,820
With that, an increasing amount of Chinese blockbusters

80
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
features invincible characters

81
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,080
They beat up the foreigners

82
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,260
And nothing is learn at the end

83
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,960
It's easy for Chinese people to feel like we are on top of the world,

84
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,060
But this pride had led the nation astray before

85
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,820
The prideful Ming and Qing dynasty closed off its trade to the rest of the world multiple times

86
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,620
And in the process, we missed out on the progress the west has made

87
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,959
the Age of Discovery

88
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
the Industrial Revolution

89
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,700
Next thing we know the wall of China

90
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,700
...was knocked down by cannon fire from British ships
