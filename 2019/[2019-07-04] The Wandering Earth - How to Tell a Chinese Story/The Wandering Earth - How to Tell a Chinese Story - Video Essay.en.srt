1
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,840
The Wandering Earth is a 2019 Chinese sci-fi
disaster film

2
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,520
Based on the novel of the same name

3
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,180
In the film, humanity leaves the dying sun
behind

4
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,660
Using impossibly powerful thrusters

5
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,340
Earth is taking its 2000 year long journey

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,660
Towards Alpha Centauri

7
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,690
It was a huge financial and critical success
in China

8
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,120
While it is absolutely not an all time classic

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,440
It is at least as good as...

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,600
Independence Day

11
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,740
But for the purpose of this episode

12
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,500
I want to point out one specific quality of the film

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,040
That despite its ludicrously Hollywood premise
and effects

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,700
Underneath, there is a deeply Chinese story

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,500
All good writers write about themselves

16
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,540
That's because the goal of a good writer is
not to tell stories

17
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,440
But through stories, evoke certain emotions

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,340
And emotions are such personal things

19
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,860
By necessity, all good stories are drawn from
the writer's personal experience

20
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,660
It's the Lord of the Rings and World War One

21
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,340
Where the Dead Marshes was inspired by the Battle of the Somme

22
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,360
By drawing from the writer's experience

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,500
No matter how fantastical the setting seems

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,020
Tolkien was able to make the Dead Marshes
feel real

25
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,160
Because the sense of dread was real

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,600
Experienced by Tolkien first hand.

27
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,520
Similarly, in The Wandering Earth

28
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,740
To create a post-apocalyptic dystopian China

29
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,390
The filmmaker draws inspiration from the negative
aspects of living in China

30
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,640
However trivial.

31
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,180
For the setting alone

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,090
There are these wet and dark back alleys

33
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,340
Complete with these LED store signs that are
everywhere in China

34
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,500
And of course, it's credit score and loans

35
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,980
A controversial branch of business, operating in legal grey areas

36
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,680
The tacky red banner plastered with government
slogans

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,960
The gambling

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,320
The girl dressed like a cheap night club bunny

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,560
And the pirated video games

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,960
These are all common elements of the Chinese underbelly

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,040
In reflection of the human condition

42
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,940
There is the classroom scene

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,360
Reflecting on the heavily criticized performative
education

44
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,540
The hostile and unsafe work environment

45
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,280
With worn out equipment

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,240
Tacky public service announcements that nobody
takes seriously

47
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,920
Police corruption and misfeasance

48
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,380
Where they take bribes in public

49
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,720
And still don't do their jobs

50
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,640
The state of pornography

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,200
It's illegal in China

52
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,120
So good pornography circulates like currency

53
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,760
Enough to be use for bribery

54
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,800
Every frame of this movie lives and breathes

55
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,560
It doesn't have to tell you how chaotic and lawless this world is

56
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,840
Through the iconography that the filmmaker draws from real life

57
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,200
The film evokes an emotion among viewers that feels real and grounded

58
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,920
Compare this to L.O.R.D., which was "inspired"
by Fate/Stay Night

59
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,100
Or Eragon, inspired by Star Wars and Lord
of the Rings

60
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,360
The world is nothing but cliches and exposition

61
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,200
Because those films are trying to tell other
people's stories

62
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,500
Instead of telling their experience

63
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,520
Their emotions

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,500
But that's just the art direction

65
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,279
We need to go deeper

66
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,239
Because the philosophy behind
The Wandering Earth is also a Chinese one.

67
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,340
Stories of humans leaving Earth behind due
to catastrophe are not rare

68
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,840
But the mass exodus usually happens on a spaceship

69
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,220
I'm going to make a bold generalization here

70
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,660
But I think a lot of you would agree
These movies draw their philosophy

71
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,000
From Noah's ark.

72
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,680
In the west, when nature is destroyed
It's usually unstoppable

73
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,860
Like the wrath of god

74
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,280
Humans live in god's creation

75
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,120
So when god's creation comes to an end

76
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,820
Humanity is at god's mercy

77
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,560
In Chinese mythology, however

78
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,900
There is no such supreme being

79
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,560
Humans and gods alike obey the natural order

80
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,690
The "Tao", if you will.

81
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,120
So, in Chinese flood myths

82
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,200
The hole in the sky is patched up by a goddess

83
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,060
The flood from the Yellow River was contained
and drained

84
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,360
By human constructions over the course of 13 long years

85
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,750
The Chinese equivalent of the Icarus myth

86
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,680
Talks about a man chasing the sun and dies
of thirst

87
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,460
But he leaves behind a peach forest as a water
supply

88
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,320
So that future generations may continue the
chase

89
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,120
In Chinese mythology, and thus, philosophy

90
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,080
Nature is malleable

91
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,340
It can be shaped

92
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,820
It can be conquered

93
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,060
It may take generations of effort

94
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,389
But it is possible, and honorable

95
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,220
To move the Earth.

96
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,000
In fact, The Wandering Earth is just a sci-fi
retelling of a Chinese legend

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,880
It's a story about a foolish old man

98
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,140
And his quest to dig through a pair of mountains

99
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,480
For the simple reason of them obstructing
his home

100
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,260
When he is told that this is impossible

101
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,360
That he'll never finish this within his lifetime

102
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,420
He says

103
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,020
"It's fine"

104
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,760
"We still have our children"

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,800
"And our children have children later"

106
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,940
Definitely someday

107
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,000
"The ice will melt"

108
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,340
And with that, we can finally talk about the
theme of The Wandering Earth

109
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,020
The core message that makes this story, a
Chinese story

110
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,380
The value of home.

111
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,380
The question that every single Chinese kid
asks

112
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,220
When they first hear the mountain moving legend

113
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,740
Is "why don't they just move?"

114
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,300
And, I only truly learned the answer after
I grew up

115
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,720
In Chinese, the word for home and family is
the same.

116
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,220
The distinction between the two exists

117
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,880
But not to the same degree as in North American culture

118
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,920
In the west, we sometimes say
"Home is where the family is"

119
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,200
"Asgard is not a place, it's a people"

120
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,600
China, however, doesn't share this view.

121
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,600
With thousands of years of history rooted
in agriculture

122
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,040
The land is just as much a family member,
as the people

123
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,260
For Chinese people, the land is the witness
of a continuous legacy

124
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,960
It's the imprint of history

125
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,480
Thus, when you move

126
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,560
You leave the history behind

127
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,400
And that is unacceptable to the culture that,
to this day

128
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,260
Still practices ancestor worship

129
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,260
Later in the film, humanity faces a dilemma

130
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:46,520
We must choose between recreating human life from scratch on a foreign planet

131
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,680
"300,000 human embryos are stored at the
space station Navigation Platform,"

132
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,580
"Along with 100 million seedlings base."

133
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,320
Or risk everything trying to keep the Earth in one piece

134
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,760
To Chinese culture

135
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,100
Home, is part of the civilization

136
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,000
It cannot be digitized

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,220
It cannot be restarted

138
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,620
It's the reason the foolish old man chooses
not to move

139
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,080
It's the reason humanity didn't leave Earth
on spaceships

140
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,640
Because even if we have to reshape nature

141
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,960
It's worth it, for our home.

142
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,660
Knowing all of these is maybe what makes the
film worked for me

143
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,620
Characters make rash, emotional decisions

144
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,140
Like real humans

145
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,500
And all their decisions are made surrounding
different concepts of home

146
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,240
A military team is failing their mission

147
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,740
And if carry on, some of them will likely die.

148
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,440
So one of them sabotages the entire mission

149
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,400
To keep the team together

150
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,580
When Earth's destruction seems imminent

151
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,440
Some of us would give up hope

152
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:04,220
And prefer to spend our last moments with
our families

153
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,420
"I want to go home"

154
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,900
"To meet my mother"

155
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,540
When the protagonist's young sister is falling
to her death

156
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,379
Her brother, without hesitation or even a
plan

157
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,300
Jumps for her

158
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,000
And the astronaut who sacrifice himself

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,200
Didn't really do it for the good of humanity

160
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,540
But for his son

161
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,880
"Come..."

162
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
"My son"

163
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,480
I admit, I'm very bias towards this film

164
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,439
Being an immigrant

165
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,020
I have been adfried and wandering since I
was a teenager

166
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,240
So this film hits me on a personal level

167
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,920
But, despite its shortcomings

168
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,920
The emotion behind The Wandering Earth rings true

169
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,240
The core message feels authentic

170
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,360
The fact that the film strides to be more
than a blockbuster entertainment

171
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,000
That alone, is a step above a lot of films
