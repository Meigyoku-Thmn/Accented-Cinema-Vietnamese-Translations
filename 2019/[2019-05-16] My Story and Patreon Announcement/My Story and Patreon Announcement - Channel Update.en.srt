00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,080
Hey everyone

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,580
I just launched my Patreon page

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:08,320
More info at the end.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,700
You are… looking at my personal work.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,120
I have been creating these small videos since
my days in university.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,140
I find the creative process to be calming.

7
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,880
One of the few times, when I can be one with
myself.

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,480
And that, to me…

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,180
Is a necessity.

10
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,860
I started Accented Cinema, as a creative project.

11
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,680
I enjoy the process.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,400
And I can to talk about things my friends
don’t understand.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,620
I grew up in the province of Guangdong in
China.

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,180
Movies from all around Asia collide in this
trading hub.

15
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,900
I could turn on the TV, and see Stephen Chow
on one channel,

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,880
Dragon Ball Z on the next,

17
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,740
and Ang Lee on another.

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,220
All of that, defined my childhood.

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,020
It was only later in life that I realized,

20
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,760
This was somewhat of an unique experience.

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,200
No one else I talk to understands what I’m
talking about.

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,620
You know that Street Fighter movie?

23
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,700
No, the one made in Hong Kong...

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,200
At age 14.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,760
I moved to Montreal with my parent.

26
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,780
It took a toll on me.

27
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,220
The world suddenly got a lot bigger.

28
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,020
And I got a lot lonelier.

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,460
I couldn’t speak a word of French.

30
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:04,120
So, movies became my main way of fooling my
brain into thinking I’m communicating.

31
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,920
It kept me busy.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,240
It drowned out my sensory inputs.

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,860
It dealt with my emotions

34
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,020
I would stay up late into the night.

35
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,260
Watching the fourth movie of the day.

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,100
Waiting for the world to end.

37
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,360
I later went to film school.

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,540
Because I didn’t know much else.

39
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,300
When others spent their times discovering
themselves.

40
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,260
All my times were devoted on movies,

41
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,560
good or bad.

42
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,440
In college, I learnt how to speak.

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,360
Both English, and film.

44
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,700
I spoke to no one in particular.

45
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,400
And no one was listening.

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,840
It was mostly essays and scripts.

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,620
But the process of creation, however simple,
gave me a voice.

48
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,020
Suddenly, I could speak again.

49
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,080
I could forget my accent.

50
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,460
I’m in control of my body…

51
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,820
I have things to say...

52
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,100
Accented Cinema started out as just another
creative project.

53
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,120
Something to keep me busy.

54
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,140
It’s like singing in the shower.

55
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:28,720
I just want to talk about my childhood memories.

56
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,980
Questions I wondered about.

57
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,079
Films I grew up with.

58
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,459
I talked.

59
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,500
And twenty thousand of you decided to listen.

60
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,480
I’m making this video,

61
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,700
because reality finally struck me.

62
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,740
That I am not alone any more.

63
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,020
My voice has gathered a crowd.

64
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,340
And they are talking back

65
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,520
This is not my channel any more.

66
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,960
This is our channel now.

67
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,660
Thank you, for being here.

68
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,120
Hey everyone

69
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,250
Thanks for watching this random extra video.

70
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,959
If you follow this channel, you probably know

71
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,520
Two of our videos have been copyright claimed

72
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,490
And dispute rejected.

73
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,560
Each video in this channel takes about 40
to 60 hours of research, writing and editing.

74
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,740
Without a stable revenue, the channel cannot
stay afloat.

75
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,820
This is why I launched my Patreon page

76
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,580
A place where you can purchase extra perks,

77
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,760
and directly support this channel financially.

78
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,540
You can get extra videos, script previews,
vote on video topics

79
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,800
And also be more involved in the creative
process.

80
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,420
If you’d like to help, hop on over to my
Patreon page and have a look.

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,840
If you can’t afford direct donation, that

82
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,760
Stick around and keep watching our videos.

83
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,100
Regardless, you have my sincerest of gratitude.

84
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,040
See you in the next episode.
