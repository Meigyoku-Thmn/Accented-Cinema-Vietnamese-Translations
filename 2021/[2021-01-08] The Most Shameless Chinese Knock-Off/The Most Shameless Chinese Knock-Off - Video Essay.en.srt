Skillshare

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:08,048
Okay, before I show you the actual footage from the movie...

4
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:10,386
(Trust me, it looks nothing like the thumbnail)

5
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:13,107
Let me show you the end credits, first

6
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:14,881
Yes, the credits.

7
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,182
I have a problem with the credits

8
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:18,372
Because, you see

9
00:00:18,372 --> 00:00:19,809
This movie's credits...

10
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:22,417
Are RIPPED from another movie!

11
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:25,568
Just with slight alterations to each person's name

12
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:28,688
Even the credits are a knock-off!

13
00:00:29,343 --> 00:00:30,741
Makes sense, though

14
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:34,379
Because there is no way in hell that THIS MOVIE...

15
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:36,809
Has THIS many artists behind it

16
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:39,590
That's the god damn movie, people!

17
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,204
Just soak it all in!

18
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:44,792
This is The Autobots

19
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:46,477
Yes, it's actually called that

20
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:51,516
And it is, in my opinion, the most shameless Chinese movie ever made

21
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:54,709
The English title rips-off the Transformers

22
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:59,358
The Chinese title and character design copy Cars, of Pixar Studio fame

23
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:01,562
Part of the title is covered up

24
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,873
Just so it looks even closer to the Pixar title

25
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:09,480
The fact that the poster bears more resemblance to Cars 2's poster

26
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,488
Than the actual film itself

27
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,661
Makes the intention very clear

28
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:16,904
Like many egregious cases of Chinese knock-offs

29
00:01:16,904 --> 00:01:19,780
This movie was mocked around the world

30
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,332
CNN from the US reported on it

31
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,294
SET News from Taiwan made fun of it

32
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,402
Nippon TV from Japan investigated it

33
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:34,026
But, there is one place where the reaction is often overlooked, at least in the west...

34
00:01:34,026 --> 00:01:37,069
How did Chinese filmgoers react to this?

35
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:38,937
"There's a good meme on the internet"

36
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:42,000
"The cleanest water has no fish"

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,603
"The cheapest person has no shame"

38
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:47,834
Today, let me tell you the story of The Autobots

39
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:49,917
From its on-screen hilarity

40
00:01:49,917 --> 00:01:51,704
To behind-the-scenes drama

41
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:54,735
And yes, to domestic audience reception

42
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:58,132
Let me help you make sense of this madness

43
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:02,377
And also, peer into the side of Chinese pop culture you don't often hear about

44
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,870
This is the most shameless Chinese movie

45
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,228
Ever made

46
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,901
THE MOST SHAMELESS CHINESE KNOCK-OFF

47
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:12,425
CHAPTER ONE

48
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:16,230
The story tells a 9-year-old... engineer?

49
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,179
Who wants to make the coolest, most badass smart car ever

50
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:24,179
But ends up making 3 cars, each with its own personality flaws

51
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:26,169
K1 is too restless

52
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:28,992
(And also flirtatious for some godforsaken reason)

53
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:33,208
Behold, the most annoying character introduction of all time

54
00:02:33,208 --> 00:02:34,425
"Call me K1!"

55
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:35,907
"Uhh... 1 as in number one!"

56
00:02:35,907 --> 00:02:37,336
"Ahoo, I'm number one!"

57
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:39,695
"Yeah! I'm the champion, number one!"

58
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:41,074
"Number one champion!"

59
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:42,661
"Yahoo!"

60
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:44,792
Does anyone feel dirty after that?

61
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:47,170
I feel like I will be charged 6 dollars per minute

62
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,256
For hearing that voice on a phone

63
00:02:50,724 --> 00:02:53,434
Anyway, K2 is too rigid in programing

64
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:54,933
"Sorry, master"

65
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,827
"Please give me a precise coordinate"

66
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:59,496
"Which direction, for how many meters"

67
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:01,554
Simone Giertz would be proud

68
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:03,250
K3...

69
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,195
I think he's supposed to be lazy

70
00:03:05,195 --> 00:03:07,834
But he looks more like he's drugged up the ass

71
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:10,209
I would too, if I was in this movie

72
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:12,461
"Why doesn't K3 move?"

73
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,937
"Oh~ Right?

74
00:03:13,937 --> 00:03:16,217
"He should open his eyes"

75
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:18,000
"Run towards us"

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,577
"And play with me in the lab"

77
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,627
Oh my god, this horny car needs to calm the f**k down

78
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:26,624
"Dadadada, dadada"

79
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:27,998
Anyway, after their completion

80
00:03:27,998 --> 00:03:31,410
The four decide to participate in a racing championship

81
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,860
In hopes of winning the coveted poop-shaped trophy

82
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,660
Thus begins a long and treacherously boring journey of training

83
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,917
And by training, I mean none of that

84
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,595
Bad weather? Upgrade

85
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:45,277
Potholes? Upgrade

86
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:47,737
Need someone to do chores? Upgrade

87
00:03:47,737 --> 00:03:48,632
Got sick?

88
00:03:48,632 --> 00:03:50,162
"I'm so sick.

89
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,474
Can you bring me home?"

90
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:55,443
Someone should neuter this oversized Lovense
Lush

91
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:57,400
Finally, the big day came

92
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,000
And all of their hard works paid off

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,375
Cannonballs? Weather shield upgrade

94
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,759
Potholes? Suspension upgrade

95
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:07,042
Traps? Household chore upgrade

96
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:08,438
And most importantly

97
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:11,486
With each other's help, they overcome their flaws

98
00:04:11,486 --> 00:04:13,870
Cheered on by all 4 audience members

99
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,534
In an epic slow-motion finale

100
00:04:16,534 --> 00:04:17,463
They win

101
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,959
And the movie just immediately ends

102
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,886
Yep, 20 seconds after they cross the finish line

103
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:24,815
Credits

104
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:27,302
Oh well, at least it has a finale

105
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:29,443
SPONSOR MESSAGE

106
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:32,555
In our video about Mulan, I made fun of the animators

107
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:34,877
For creating a shoddy looking phoenix

108
00:04:34,877 --> 00:04:37,394
And tell them to sign up for Skillshare

109
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,653
God, I wish I saved that joke for this video instead

110
00:04:40,653 --> 00:04:42,775
Skillshare is an online learning community

111
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:46,685
With thousands of inspiring classes for creative and curious people

112
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:48,585
For the director of this film

113
00:04:48,585 --> 00:04:53,250
I recommend "Character Design Crash Course: Dynamic Design in Four Steps"

114
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,679
A beginner course for emerging cartoonists to come up with

115
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:57,766
*cough cough*

116
00:04:57,766 --> 00:05:00,696
ORIGINAL DESIGNS OF THEIR OWN!

117
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:03,300
Other class topics include writing

118
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,003
Editing

119
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:04,684
Compositing

120
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:06,000
And animation

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,670
Classes are concise, ad-free, and affordable

122
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,886
Less than ten dollars a month with an annual subscription

123
00:05:11,886 --> 00:05:14,521
The first 1000 people to use the link in my description

124
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:17,448
Will get a free trial of Skillshare Premium Membership

125
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:19,511
So you can explore your creativity

126
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:23,550
All jokes aside, we all want 2021 to be a better year

127
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,954
And one of the best way to make the year better

128
00:05:25,954 --> 00:05:27,609
Is to make yourself better

129
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:31,569
So, for real, I really do recommend giving Skillshare a try

130
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:36,000
Especially their workshops, which encourage you to create something

131
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:39,090
The most important thing is to get started, right?

132
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,875
So, what are you waiting for?

133
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:43,334
CHAPTER TWO

134
00:05:43,334 --> 00:05:45,062
In a previous video of mine

135
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:48,380
I called Pure Hearts the worst Chinese movie ever made

136
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:51,675
While, visually, The Autobots is god awful

137
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:54,535
I still think that Pure Heart is the worse of the two

138
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:57,236
Mainly because The Autobots is at least coherent

139
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:59,867
But also, it isn't actually a movie

140
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:00,987
Not really

141
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:03,334
The Autobots was a TV animation

142
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:06,329
And like many other cheap toddlers shows around the world

143
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,459
No one really gives a sh*t about it

144
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,020
It also helps that the animation is so poorly made

145
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,909
It takes a second for you to realize who they are copying

146
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,460
The show was later stitched together into a feature film

147
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,138
And pushed into theatres for a quick buck

148
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:26,371
The controversy didn't start until the theatrical poster came out

149
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:30,537
Which, in a way, is more of a knock off than the movie itself

150
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,455
This similarity is, of course, immediately noticed by everyone

151
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,606
Nippon TV contacted the director for a comment

152
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,792
To which the director denied all accusations

153
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:44,959
Claiming it is just... learning from Disney

154
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,000
And this is where the crapshoot begins

155
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:53,917
Understandably, Chinese social media users sided with Nippon TV on this

156
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:57,917
Unlike Pure Hearts, which was mostly mocked and made fun of

157
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:02,305
Reviews for The Autobots were mostly of anger and frustration

158
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,343
Many called it shameful

159
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:06,705
Some wished Pixar would sue them

160
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:10,832
In response, the director accused critics of being, quote...

161
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:13,070
"A New Generation of Traitors"

162
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,859
Siding with "foreigners" instead of "supporting Chinese animation"

163
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:20,947
And blamed everyone for the film's poor box office return

164
00:07:21,286 --> 00:07:22,649
If you know about Disney

165
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,005
The number one rule is, you do not piss off Disney

166
00:07:26,163 --> 00:07:29,584
And, as you would expect, the Autobots got sued

167
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:33,610
Facing a lawsuit, the director has the gall to claim that

168
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,369
The Autobots is an independent creation

169
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:39,614
And accused Disney of abusing the legal system

170
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:41,306
While in the middle of a lawsuit

171
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:43,313
The director announced a sequel

172
00:07:43,313 --> 00:07:45,210
Which never materialized

173
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,455
Thank f**k

174
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:51,360
And the kicker is, this film was pushed out allegedly as a way

175
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,136
For the director to exploit a loophole in government fundings

176
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:57,986
With its production company based in Xiamen

177
00:07:57,986 --> 00:08:00,637
A city with media production fund programs

178
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:04,285
This film is eligible for 255 thousand Yuan

179
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:07,571
Or about 39 thousand US dollars in funding

180
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:12,363
It's probably more than enough to recoup the production cost and then some

181
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,189
In the end, Disney won the lawsuit

182
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:16,509
What else do you expect?

183
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:21,473
The news was reported by Mtime, one of China's largest cinema network

184
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:23,102
Their headline?

185
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:23,831
"REJOICE!

186
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:27,826
'The Autobots' Ruled As Copyright Infringement"

187
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,000
What a sh*t show

188
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:31,834
CHAPTER THREE

189
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:33,749
Do you know Genshin Impact?

190
00:08:33,917 --> 00:08:36,096
Yeah it's one of those games that came out

191
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:38,651
Riding the success of Breath of the Wild

192
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:42,749
I suspect a lot of people didn't realize that this is a Chinese made game

193
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:46,572
Since "made in China" has a very negative connotation

194
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:49,192
The developer is likely aware of this, too

195
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:54,000
Which is why this game has its title in Japanese instead of Chinese

196
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:56,816
Anyway, the reception of the game is...

197
00:08:56,816 --> 00:08:58,625
"Wait, what the f**k"

198
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,180
"SHE'S SO CUTE!"

199
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,884
... generally positive

200
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,492
After all, games that copy other games are nothing new

201
00:09:05,492 --> 00:09:08,772
Ubisoft just released their own take on the same formula

202
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:12,625
And gamers are okay with it, as long as the product is good

203
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,374
But there is one place that really hates this game...

204
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:20,003
China

205
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:24,700
Now, you probably noticed that I haven't been very neutral in this video

206
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,440
That's because I, along with so many other Chinese artists and viewers

207
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,720
Am not only angry at this film

208
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,060
But the entire industry of Chinese knock offs

209
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,069
And that's a side of the story you don't often hear about

210
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,907
Mockbusters are not exclusively a Chinese phenomenon

211
00:09:42,907 --> 00:09:43,693
Far from it

212
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:46,415
Yet, when you hear the word knock-offs

213
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:50,711
Your thoughts, and my thoughts, are almost always the same

214
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:52,959
"Of course it's China"

215
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:56,780
It is the equivalent of hearing news of an anti-mask protest

216
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,508
And going "of course it's America"

217
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,703
As an American, you know it's not your fault

218
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,681
And you dislike these people just as much

219
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:10,148
But it frustrates you that THAT is what your fellow people are doing

220
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:15,569
And this is why Chinese filmgoers would rather side with the media that make fun of China

221
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:20,549
Than stand with the film that represents the worst of the Chinese creative industry

222
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,404
Chinese people, especially the urban, middle
class, educated people

223
00:10:25,404 --> 00:10:28,350
Are increasingly frustrated with Chinese knock offs

224
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,086
Partly due to this international perception

225
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:33,773
At the risk of sounding overly sensitive

226
00:10:33,773 --> 00:10:36,244
Here is a personal example

227
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:41,750
To this day, people still comment under our Chinese sword video with the same joke

228
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:44,340
Why are Chinese swords not as famous?

229
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,716
"Because they were made in China"

230
00:10:46,964 --> 00:10:51,540
It's so normalized, people don't think it is an insult anymore

231
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,250
Despite the subtext being "nothing good comes from China"

232
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,649
And if something good is made in China

233
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:00,000
It will not be recognized as such

234
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,967
Even by its own creators

235
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:04,722
But the main reason for our hatred

236
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:08,800
Is just that, we are tired of seeing cheaters win

237
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,580
Guo Jingming, one of the most famous young writers in China

238
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,197
Plagiarized most of his famous works

239
00:11:15,197 --> 00:11:22,136
He was sued in 2003 by fellow writer Zhuang Yu, whose work was plagiarized by Guo

240
00:11:22,294 --> 00:11:26,502
Guo lost the lawsuit, but refused to apologize

241
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,438
He went on to become a director, writing and directing the notoriously bad "Tiny Times" series

242
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:36,454
With the first film alone grossing 484 million Yuan

243
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:39,054
Against its 45 million Yuan budget

244
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:45,946
Similarly, Chinese screenwriter Yu Zheng was sued by famous author Chiung Yao for plagiarism

245
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:47,667
He lost the case

246
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:52,330
Yet, he remains one of the most prolific screenwriters in the industry

247
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,926
And this sh*tty film grossed nearly 5 million Yuan

248
00:11:55,926 --> 00:12:00,000
Although the production company claims it has a 10 million Yuan budget

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,240
I doubt that's the case

250
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:06,000
The public's frustration reached a boiling point recently

251
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,410
On December 31st, 2020

252
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,775
15 years after Guo losing the case

253
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:15,375
He and Yu Zheng finally apologized publically

254
00:12:15,488 --> 00:12:16,625
Why?

255
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,795
Because just 9 days earlier

256
00:12:18,795 --> 00:12:26,390
Over 156 media personnel cosigned an open letter, calling for the boycott of plagiarists

257
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:30,805
In which these two buttwipes were named specifically

258
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:36,459
Almost immediately, Yu Zheng is edited out of a variety show he appeared in

259
00:12:36,459 --> 00:12:39,667
And a new show he wrote is now postponed

260
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:43,264
It seemed like justice is finally being served

261
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:47,505
The comments under their apologies are not acceptance

262
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:49,019
It's not even rejoicing

263
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,010
Some expressed relief

264
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,459
Most are still angry

265
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:58,306
And now you know why Chinese people find this movie so infuriating

266
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,635
CONCLUSION

267
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:02,926
I hate The Autobots

268
00:13:02,926 --> 00:13:04,926
And so do people in China

269
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:07,984
Because it stands as the most glaring symptom

270
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:11,500
Of the rotten core within the Chinese creative industry

271
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,737
An industry where it pays to be a cheater

272
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,416
There are so many artists in China

273
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:21,417
Especially animators, who choose a life a hardship

274
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:25,804
Just to have a chance of pushing the Chinese animation industry forward

275
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,701
The director of Ne Zha graduated med school

276
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:30,731
Yet, instead of becoming a doctor

277
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:34,196
He decided to go into animation, self-taught

278
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:38,652
Because he loves the industry and wants to help make it better

279
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:43,440
He spent 3 years crafting his debut short film while living in poverty

280
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,787
He couldn't even afford Internet at home

281
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:49,880
If he needed to go online, he had to go to his friend's house

282
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:56,125
Yet you're telling me this creatively bankrupted f**kface is the most popular writer in China

283
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,385
And this horny car made it into the theatres?

284
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:03,358
Luckily, both the audience and the industry are changing

285
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:07,750
Ne Zha eventually became the highest-grossing animated film in China

286
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,788
Original films are being valued more and more

287
00:14:10,788 --> 00:14:14,950
While copycats, even high-quality ones, are being called out

288
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,970
I sincerely hope the notoriety of The Autobots is a sign of change

289
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,042
That cheaters are being kicked out

290
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:26,082
That the truly passionate artists are finally getting the spotlight

291
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,400
Perhaps one day

292
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,000
China can shed away the knock-off label

293
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,200
And produce something truly loved by people around the world

294
00:14:34,313 --> 00:14:36,068
And hopefully, next time

295
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:39,365
They don't have to hide behind a Japanese name
