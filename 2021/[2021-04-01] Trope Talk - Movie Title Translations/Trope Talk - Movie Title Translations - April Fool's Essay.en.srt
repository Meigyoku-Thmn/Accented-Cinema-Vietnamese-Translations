1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,339
Alright, how do you translate a movie title?

2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:05,877
"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"

3
00:00:05,877 --> 00:00:07,046
Let's take that as an example

4
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:09,230
Well, you can always translate it word by word

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:10,565
But then you hit the word massacre

6
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:11,904
And no matter what synonym you use

7
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:14,110
It's bringing up connotations that... shouldn't be there

8
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:16,300
So you fudge the title a bit

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,340
Ah yes, "Texas Chain Saw Homocidal Maniac"

10
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,160
It tells you precisely the genre, the character, and the tone

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,300
That's the level of intricacies you have to deal with

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,440
Taking history, culture

13
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,459
And a whole bunch of other language-specific things into consideration

14
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,409
Chinese translation is especially annoying

15
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:32,439
Not just because of how different these two languages work

16
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:35,675
But because there are no less than 3 different Chinese speaking film industries

17
00:00:35,675 --> 00:00:36,780
Four if you count Singapore

18
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,235
Sometimes, these markets can agree on a translation

19
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:40,957
But more often than not... they don't

20
00:00:41,097 --> 00:00:42,759
Yeah, they all mean the same thing

21
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,883
Just different wordings

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,949
But this situation also gives us a treasure trove of titles we can compare and contrast

23
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:50,000
So... let's do just that!

24
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:53,339
Broadly speaking, there are four ways you can translate a title

25
00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:54,902
The first one is "literal translation"

26
00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:57,422
Sticking as close to the original meaning as possble

27
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:59,412
This is the simplest and safest method

28
00:00:59,412 --> 00:01:01,023
Very little room for misinterpretations

29
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,899
Which is why it's usually used on big budget blockbusters

30
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,587
But just because the translation is literal

31
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:07,000
Doesn't mean it can't be interesting

32
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,440
The 1996 horror movie Scream is translated literally by Mainland and Taiwan

33
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,152
Meaning "Screaming in fear"

34
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:14,840
(They are the exact same title, by the way)

35
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,820
(Just difference between traditional and simplified Chinese)

36
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,970
It's intentionally vague and kinda silly

37
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,000
Just like its English title

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,946
Alluding to the film's self-aware tone

39
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,125
But Hong Kong went one step further

40
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,897
You see, the last character here is a pun, meaning "call"

41
00:01:26,897 --> 00:01:29,534
It can mean "A Deadly Call for Help", like a scream

42
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:31,810
But also mean "A Deadly Call On the Phone"

43
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,545
Referring to the opening sequence

44
00:01:33,545 --> 00:01:37,080
The 2000 French Romantic Comedy Amélie is another example

45
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,800
Taiwan's "Amélie's Fantasy World" is actually closer to the original French Title

46
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,464
“Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain”

47
00:01:42,464 --> 00:01:43,587
(Yeah, I can speak French)

48
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,890
But Hong Kong and Mainland translates Amélie's name phonetically into a pun

49
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,524
It sounds like "Angel Amélie"

50
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:50,496
But reads like "Angel Loves Beauty"

51
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:51,730
Which is clever, because in a way

52
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,930
The movie is about Amélie learning to love the beauty of the world

53
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,300
And bringing happiness to people... like an angel

54
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,421
I would give it a chef kiss

55
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:59,464
But this movie is French, not Italian

56
00:01:59,604 --> 00:02:02,860
That said, literal translation is safe but not perfect

57
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,480
For one thing, you have to choose your words carefully

58
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,750
Mainland China translates the Fast and Furious series as "Speed and Passion"

59
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,464
Sounds about right

60
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:14,498
But the word they choose for passion has a slight sexual connotation these days

61
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:17,900
It sounds kinda weird and dirty to a Chinese ear

62
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:21,903
I guess that's why there are so many homoerotic fanfics bbout the two protagonists

63
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:24,017
Now that I think about it, maybe it's intentional...?

64
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,760
And then sometimes, a title just flat out can't be translated

65
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,501
Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is one of those

66
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:33,101
The "Pulp" in "Pulp Fiction" came from the type of paper used for cheap novels

67
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:37,097
These novels usually feature sex, drugs, guns and all sort of tropes

68
00:02:37,097 --> 00:02:39,709
It's a term that only really makes sense in English

69
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,227
Mainland translated it as "Low-Brow Novel"

70
00:02:42,227 --> 00:02:46,586
The surface-level meaning is preserved, but the context is pretty much entirely lost

71
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:50,275
Personally, I think Hong Kong's "Dangerous Personnel" best captures the vibe

72
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:53,959
And that leads to our second way of translating a title: reinterpretation

73
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,583
Instead of translating from the English title

74
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:58,609
This is when you come up with your own title by interpreting the plot

75
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:01,900
It's usually a good way to deal with titles that can't be easily translated

76
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,479
The aforementioned "Dangerous Personnel" is a good example of this

77
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,167
Christopher Nolan's Inception is another example

78
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:10,760
It's about a bunch of thieves running around people's dream where reality is distorted

79
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,517
The word "Inception" sounds cool and thrilling and imposing and cerebral

80
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:17,467
An there isn't an equivalent word in Chinese

81
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:20,971
Taiwan attempted a literal translation "Full-Scale Initiation"

82
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:23,340
Which is close... but not quite there

83
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,859
That's why Mainland and Hong Kong came up with their own titles

84
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:28,093
Mainland calls it "Dream Theft Dimension"

85
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:30,209
Which I think is absolutely amazing

86
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,209
Hong Kong's "Dimensional Infiltration" gives it a bit more of a spy thriller edge

87
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:37,019
Matrix is another one with no equivalent words in Chinese

88
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:39,089
At least nothing as sci-fi and cool sounding

89
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:40,360
... It sounds nerdy as heck

90
00:03:40,593 --> 00:03:45,072
So instead, Taiwan and Mainland both translate it as the awesome sounding "Empire of Hackers"

91
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:47,542
Capturing the scale and the coolness factor

92
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:51,286
Hong Kong's "22nd Century Killer Network" is... less cool

93
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,750
(Yeah I don't know why they call it that)

94
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,909
Hong Kong's title for The Truman Show is great, though

95
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:59,329
The title comes from a 24/7 reality show about the main character Truman

96
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:01,584
Unknowingly living in a fabricated reality

97
00:04:01,584 --> 00:04:04,854
Mainland and Taiwan went with the relatively safe "Truman's World"

98
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:07,090
Hong Kong went with "Reality Show"

99
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,939
But wait! it's not reality!

100
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:10,219
Exactly!

101
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:15,174
In fact, going word by word, the title literally means "A show featuring real humans"

102
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:16,517
And the movie is about Truman

103
00:04:16,517 --> 00:04:17,410
A "True Man"

104
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,723
And how his humanity breaks him out of a fake TV reality

105
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:23,834
Spike Jonze indie sci-fi romance film, Her, talks about a geek

106
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:26,766
Falling in love with an AI who sounds like Scarlet Johansson

107
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,752
Mainland just has a direct translation

108
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:30,530
Hong Kong is a bit more poetic

109
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,772
But Taiwan completely reinterprets the title

110
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,700
Calling it "Cloud-based Lover"

111
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,250
Which not only hints at the technology behind the AI

112
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,601
But also the distance between the two characters

113
00:04:39,601 --> 00:04:40,744
And her intangibility

114
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:42,050
That's freaking awesome!

115
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:44,439
Okay, one more. Because this is fun

116
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,651
Inglourious Basterds

117
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:50,010
Tarantino's Nazisploitation film about a group of Jewish soldiers hunting nazis for sport

118
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,779
While Mainland and Taiwan gave a pretty straight-forward translation

119
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,920
Hong Kong just GETS Tarantino

120
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,412
I swear I'm not making this up

121
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:57,485
"Demon Hitler"

122
00:04:57,485 --> 00:04:59,241
"Versus Homicidal Maniacs"

123
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:01,374
It's ridiculous until you realize

124
00:05:01,374 --> 00:05:04,026
That's exactly the kind of movie Tarantino makes

125
00:05:04,026 --> 00:05:04,987
Nazisploitation!

126
00:05:04,987 --> 00:05:08,471
Like She Wolf of the SS, just done well and tasteful

127
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:11,239
I guess Hong Kong and Tarantino just love each other

128
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:14,250
Did you know Mighty Peking Man was distributed by Tarantino in the West?

129
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,144
Now, reinterpretation may sound great

130
00:05:16,144 --> 00:05:18,590
But it does have at least 2 potential pitfalls

131
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,630
The first one is...

132
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,729
Well, sometimes, it doesn't age well

133
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,810
The Mission Impossible series was called "Spies on a Disk" in Mainland China

134
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,419
Referring to the list of spy names mcguffin in the first movie

135
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:30,940
But then the series continues without that thing ever showing up again

136
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,236
And the title just completely loses all meaning

137
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:34,695
The Terminator is another example

138
00:05:34,695 --> 00:05:36,359
Instead of using the villain's name

139
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,616
Hong Kong titled it after the hero's identity

140
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:41,066
Kyle Reese is a warrior, and he is from the future

141
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:43,229
But then the sequels put more emphasis on the Terminators

142
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:46,017
And Kyle Reese is almost entirely forgotten

143
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:49,269
The second translation pitfall is straight-up misinterpretations

144
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:52,100
This is when the translator doesn't get the movie

145
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,479
Manchester by the Sea is a drama about a man confronting his own path after his brother's death

146
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,690
Hong Kong translates it as "Love Ties to the Seaside Town"

147
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:03,259
But... it's not a love story, and it doesn't have that much to do with love

148
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:06,123
It puts the movie in a genre it doesn't belong

149
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:07,473
Contact is another one

150
00:06:07,473 --> 00:06:09,449
It's about an astronomer trying to contact alien life

151
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,329
While also dealing with her past trauma

152
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,996
So the Taiwanese title "Contact the Future"

153
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:17,100
Is kinda the polar opposite of what the astronomer is doing

154
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,350
She isn't really reaching to the future as much as she's freeing herself from the
past

155
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,340
If you are planning on reinterpreting the movie title

156
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,892
You better be sure you have a firm understanding of the movie

157
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:29,009
Onto the third way of translating: poetic translation

158
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:33,153
This is when you incorporate cultural context from the Chinese language into your translation

159
00:06:33,153 --> 00:06:35,238
Kubrick's Lolita is a good example of this

160
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:38,129
A movie about a man's inappropriate obsession with an underage girl

161
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:41,467
The original book has a phonetically translated title in all three regions

162
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,795
But when the movie got released

163
00:06:42,795 --> 00:06:45,150
Hong Kong and Taiwan got a bit... cheeky with the title

164
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:47,618
It reads "A Pear Tree Crushing a Begonia"

165
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:51,350
Which came from a famous poem written to mock old men who marry young women

166
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,614
It's beautiful on the surface

167
00:06:52,614 --> 00:06:55,021
But a "big yikes" when you think about it

168
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:57,100
So, a perfect fit for this movie

169
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:59,670
Another similar example would be "Knives Out"

170
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,682
A murder mystery filled with tension

171
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:04,549
Both Mainland and Taiwan chose existing idioms for their title

172
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,790
Mainland chose "Sharp Blade Unsheathed"

173
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,930
Meaning tension is high, people are one step away from killing each other

174
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,353
Taiwan chose "Blades Curved And Roads Turned"

175
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:14,642
Meaning the story has taken an unexpected turn

176
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,545
Both titles reference the knives motif

177
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:19,294
But also gives additional context through cultural references

178
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:21,595
Now, you don't always have to be classy, either

179
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:22,449
Sharknado-

180
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:25,662
Yes, Sharknado, a movie about sharks flying in a tornado

181
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:28,883
Has one of the most poetic and funny Chinese titles I've ever seen

182
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,060
In Chinese, tornado is called "Dragon twisting wind"

183
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,959
Naturally, mainland and Hong Kong replaced one of the words with shark

184
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,225
And it works

185
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,079
But Taiwan hilariously referenced a classic pop song

186
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:42,729
In which the lyrics describe a romantic image of the desert sands dancing in the wind

187
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,329
And since the words "sand" and "shark" are homonyms...

188
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:47,700
Well, now a hilarious mental image is stuck in your head

189
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:49,059
Genius.

190
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,523
Of course, like other methods

191
00:07:50,523 --> 00:07:52,317
Poetic translations can go wrong

192
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:56,997
Disney's Coco is a movie about a kid traveling the world of the dead , trying to find his musical idol

193
00:07:56,997 --> 00:08:00,162
Mainland's "Dream Chase Odyssey", good translation

194
00:08:00,162 --> 00:08:04,167
Taiwan's "Coco's Nightclub"... not so much

195
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:06,740
Okay, "nightclub" is a Taiwanese euphemism for "cemetery"

196
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,650
So, it KINDA cleverly alludes to the musical theme, the theme of death, and the dazzling lights

197
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:12,933
But all that subtext is useless

198
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:16,403
When the surface level text is more or less entirely out of whack

199
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,069
This is the definition of trying way too hard

200
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:21,610
Another seemingly beautiful one is Slumdog Millionaire

201
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,120
A movie about a young man going on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"

202
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,417
And through the show, he reconnects with his childhood love

203
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:29,919
Hong Kong gave it a very poetic title
"One Million And One Nights"

204
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,317
It references the "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" game show

205
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:33,794
It's also a metaphor for the length of time

206
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:36,317
the main character waited to meet his love again

207
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:37,751
It also feels like a fairytale

208
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,704
Because it references the book "One Thousand and One Night"

209
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:43,142
Which... It's an Arabian book

210
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,563
This movie is set in INDIA!

211
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:47,670
God damn it, Hong Kong...

212
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,217
Last, and also maybe the least exciting way

213
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:51,705
There is the marketing translation

214
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:54,507
This is when a title is fudged to make the movie more marketable

215
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,363
A basic example would be 1994's "Speed"

216
00:08:57,363 --> 00:09:00,370
A movie about a bus that explodes if it drives too slow

217
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,277
With a generic-sounding title like Speed

218
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:05,816
Hong Kong added a word to signal its genre: "Speed of Life and Death"

219
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:07,798
And since Chinese is such a compact language

220
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,186
You can usually get away with more complicated titles

221
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:13,079
Taiwan is especially fond of this types of marketing translation

222
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,861
Speed becomes "Police Protector"

223
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:16,507
Top Gun becomes "Warrior Protector"

224
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:18,670
And John Wick becomes "Mission to Protect"

225
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,400
The most infamous example is probably "Shawshank Redemption"

226
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,803
To which Taiwan gave it a nonsensical translation of...

227
00:09:23,803 --> 00:09:25,285
(And I did not make this up)

228
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:27,667
"Excitement 1995"

229
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,040
Okay, let me explain

230
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,407
When Shawshank first came out in the US, it was a box office bomb

231
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:35,124
And with a nondescript title like that, I can see why

232
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,410
So, the Taiwanese distributor marketed it as

233
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,740
A spiritual successor to the 1973 movie "The Sting"

234
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,634
Which was called "Excitement" in Taiwan

235
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:44,000
"Excitment"

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,780
"Excitment 1995"

237
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:48,707
And, as far as I know, the strategy worked!

238
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:50,559
It made box office record in Taiwan

239
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,976
So you may laugh at this, but Taiwan got it to work!

240
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:56,360
This strategy is used for many Arnold movies, too

241
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,875
They are marketed as the "Demon" series in Taiwan

242
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,000
"Demon Terminator"

243
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,152
"Demon Commando"

244
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:02,870
"Demon Emperor: True Lies"

245
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,889
"Demon Jr."

246
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:06,042
It's funny, but it works

247
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:08,540
Of course, it's not a exclusively a Taiwanese thing

248
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,060
A lot of the Pixar movies are also like this in Mainland

249
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,988
Toys Mobilized

250
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:13,183
Undersea Mobilized

251
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:14,665
Racing Cars Mobilized

252
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:15,674
Superheros Mobilized

253
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:17,893
Hong Kong has a similar shtick going on, too

254
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,800
By now, you can already see the major problem with this method

255
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,730
It's mind-numbingly boring

256
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,962
Se7en, a detective thriller about a serial murderer in the theme of the seven deadly sins is called

257
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:28,553
"Flash Point Warrant"

258
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,190
It conveys none of the mysteries and style of the movie

259
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,043
It sounds more like Donnie Yen is about to kick some ass

260
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:37,980
Shyamalan's Unbreakable is called "Tribulations of the Undying" in Mainland

261
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,874
A poetic way to describe the main character

262
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:43,579
A man who has above average physique that makes him a real-life superhero

263
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:45,123
Taiwan just calls it...

264
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:46,123
"Thrilling"...

265
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,300
I have no idea why!

266
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:52,105
So, that's four ways of translating a movie title into another language

267
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:52,940
Let's see...

268
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,708
There's "the direct translation"

269
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,949
The safe but not always possible option

270
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,208
"Reinterpretation"

271
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,743
A good option to bring in some personality

272
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,973
But you have to make sure you understand the film well enough

273
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,269
"The poetic translation"

274
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:06,260
Bringing in cultural references to provide additional context

275
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,277
And "the marketing translation"

276
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:10,000
Boring, but it works

277
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,310
Of course, these options are not mutually exclusive

278
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,329
And it's generally ideal if you can achieve more than one at a time

279
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:18,480
But like all art forms, there is no definitive way to do it right

280
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,810
That's also what makes this topic so much fun to look into

281
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,167
Have you paid attention to any movie titles lately?

282
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:24,153
Take a look next time

283
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:26,380
You might be surprised by the amount of thought that goes into it

284
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:28,394
So... Yeah.
