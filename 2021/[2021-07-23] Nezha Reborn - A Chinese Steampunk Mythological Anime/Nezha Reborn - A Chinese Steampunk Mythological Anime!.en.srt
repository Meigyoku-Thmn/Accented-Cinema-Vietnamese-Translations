3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,960
It's no secret that when someone messes with our culture 

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,480
Chinese people can get a bit.. 

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,048
"What a load of bullsh#t"

6
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:10,976
...Defensive

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,093
Look, man, it was broken before

8
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:14,647
Handle with care, okay?

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,080
We may look back at them as cinematic classics today 

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,280
But back when A Chinese Odyssey and Flirting Scholar came out 

11
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,880
Stephen Chow's unorthodox take of Chinese mythology and history 

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,717
Was wildly controversial

13
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:30,570
"Only you..."

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,459
Many saw them as undignified

15
00:00:33,459 --> 00:00:36,097
How can you take something so full of history

16
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:37,930
And turn it into something so...

17
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,610
Juvenile?

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,908
While the goalpost has shifted

19
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:45,428
Similar sentiments have never left the Chinese discourse

20
00:00:45,428 --> 00:00:47,189
"Sun Wokong is asexual"

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,360
This is the environment in which New Gods: Nezha Reborn was made 

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,498
It has everything against it

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,840
Based on Investiture of the Gods 

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,120
One of the most overused Chinese stories in recent years 

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,400
This movie drastically reinterprets its source materials 

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,298
Turning it into a... quote-unquote "Eastpunk" action anime

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,942
And somehow

28
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:16,829
This visual design was widely praised

29
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:18,353
Dafuk happened?

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,720
It reminds me of another semi-recent film based on the same story 

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,123
No, not that one

32
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,157
This one

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,800
League of Gods also drastically reinterprets the story 

34
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,919
Giving it a shiny gold paint job

35
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:32,994
Probably hoping to blind you with the shine

36
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:35,000
So you don't recognize its true color:

37
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:36,884
A piece of sh#t

38
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,773
You don't have to be Chinese to recognize that

39
00:01:40,773 --> 00:01:43,052
This movie doesn't feel Chinese at all

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,493
So that begs the question 

41
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,467
What makes this work

42
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:49,169
And not this?

43
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:55,620
[Nezha Reborn: A Chinese Steampunk Mythological Anime!?] 

44
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,648
[Chapter One]

45
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:58,320
First, some background info

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,480
Investiture of the Gods is a 16th-century Chinese novel 

47
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,280
About an epic war some 3000 years ago 

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,400
Back when Queen Elizabeth was merely a middle-aged woman

49
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,767
The book tells the rise of a number of heroes

50
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,066
One of which is Nezha

51
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:16,009
A rebellious child born with immense power

52
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,014
And a strong sense of justice

53
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,132
As with most Chinese myths

54
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:22,542
Nezha's origin story varies

55
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:26,689
For this video, we'll stick to the 1979 animated classic

56
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,240
In the story, the East Sea Dragon King has been terrorizing 

57
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,125
The city of Chentang Pass

58
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,683
Brought drought to the land

59
00:02:33,683 --> 00:02:36,696
And kidnaps children to his palace to eat

60
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:38,053
What an assh#le

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,600
Being a hero 

62
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,320
Nezha beats the living snot out of the King's henchmen 

63
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,069
Slays the Dragon Prince who came to seek revenge

64
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:47,738
And trashes the King's underwater palace

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,002
While Nezha sees this as helping the innocents

66
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:53,201
The gods, and even his own father

67
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:57,178
See this as a violent child defying the natural order

68
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,160
So, in one last act of defiance 

69
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,604
And to appease the corrupted gods

70
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:05,584
Nezha ends his own life

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,520
Thus inspiring a Bruce Lee movie many centuries later 

72
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:13,371
"I didn't have much education"

73
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:15,801
"Don't try to fool me"

74
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:18,042
Don't worry, Nezha gets resurrected

75
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,040
Nezha's story can be understood as a criticism of the feudal system 

76
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,600
A battle between innate morality 

77
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,022
And the reality that the ruling class gets to make the law

78
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,200
It is a timeless allegory

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,385
Which is why Nezha Reborn explores the same theme

80
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:36,753
But from an updated perspective

81
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,782
In Nezha Reborn

82
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:42,240
Nezha is now a smuggler, living in a slum city

83
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,007
Where the water supply is controlled by a wealthy mafia family

84
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:48,387
"It shouldn't be like this"

85
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:51,025
"But it's always like this"

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,640
One day, while protecting his sister from the mafia 

87
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,918
Nezha's inner power awakens

88
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:02,557
He can now use his power to fight back

89
00:04:02,557 --> 00:04:04,048
But each time he does

90
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:06,139
The mafia crushes down harder

91
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,807
And everyone is hurt in the crossfire

92
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,800
In its most basic form 

93
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,880
Nezha Reborn follows the original story plot point by plot point 

94
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,320
But cleverly updates the criticism from about the feudal system 

95
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,000
To wealth disparity

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,139
A hot-pressed issue around the world today

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,826
See, in the original story

98
00:04:25,826 --> 00:04:29,568
The people Nezha helped, including Nezha himself Were children

99
00:04:29,568 --> 00:04:31,831
The most helpless people in society

100
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,560
And everyone who sided with the oppressor 

101
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,433
Are officials and nobles

102
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:39,667
That includes Nezha's father, who's a general

103
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,768
Whereas in Reborn

104
00:04:41,768 --> 00:04:43,366
The dynamic has shifted

105
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:47,203
The victims of the conflict are, across the board, poor

106
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,850
Nezha is no longer a child of a noble

107
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,378
But a smuggler from a poor family

108
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,792
Cleverly, the film changes  Nezha's brother into a police officer

109
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,846
"The bureau busted another smuggling case"

110
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:01,360
A police who deals with smugglers like Nezha 

111
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,440
But has no power over the robberies and murders committed by the mafia

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,361
Every villain is either rich

113
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:09,078
Or greedy

114
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:11,440
The law only exists to control the poor

115
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,475
In other words

116
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:15,675
Even though the story looks different

117
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:17,610
Even though the angle has changed

118
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,000
The core of the message remains:

119
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,168
Is social inequality part of the natural order?

120
00:05:24,168 --> 00:05:26,922
Is violence against the oppressor necessary?

121
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,382
Is it acceptable to fight back

122
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:32,142
If it means innocent people will get hurt?

123
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,880
The Chinese audience has no problem recognizing it as Chinese 

124
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,360
Because it preserved the heart of Nezha 

125
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,960
An influential folktale that defined what Chinese culture is

126
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,840
It is a Chinese story

127
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,515

If today's video makes  you want to get into Chinese mythology

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,384
The best way to start is how I started:

131
00:05:58,384 --> 00:05:59,891
With Journey to the West

132
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:02,353
Which, you can find on Audible

133
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,714
Crazy, right?

134
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:05,112
Shouldn't be that surprising, though

135
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:08,792

[Chapter Two] 

155
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,865
With the spirit of the story preserved

156
00:06:57,865 --> 00:07:02,792
Nezha Reborn can build its visual on top of a 500-year-old solid foundation

157
00:07:03,195 --> 00:07:05,363
But not without a lot of thoughts

158
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,699
One common criticism I heard about League of Gods

159
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,406
Is its incoherent visual style

160
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:14,422
It combines styles from European high fantasy

161
00:07:14,422 --> 00:07:16,593
With Mesopotamian structures

162
00:07:16,593 --> 00:07:19,653
And glazes it with copious amounts of gold

163
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,474
No, we are not doing that

164
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,053
Aside from the fact that nothing looks Chinese

165
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:25,149
(Which shouldn't really matter)

166
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,567
(Not everything from China has to look Chinese)

167
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:30,888
How do these visual elements serve the story?

168
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,917
See, when Tolkien wrote The Lord of the Rings

169
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:38,209
He infused it with his experience as a WWI soldier

170
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,834
From the Battle of the Somme

171
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,417
To a world in decline

172
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:44,320
To Frodo's inability to return to his old life

173
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,500
When The Lord of the Rings references something

174
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,917
It doesn't just reference the visual

175
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,777
But also the history

176
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:52,730
The culture

177
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,320
And the emotion behind it

178
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,449
At first glance

179
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:59,940
Reborn may look like Final Fantasy VII meets Akira

180
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,070
But quickly

181
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,974
The film reveals its root visual inspiration:

182
00:08:03,974 --> 00:08:05,628
Republic Era China

183
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,896
With its updated story

184
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:10,472
Reborn is essentially a gangster flick

185
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:13,417
Not too dissimilar to classics like Scarface

186
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,900
The 1932 original, not the remake

187
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,640
It's a genre of film most commonly associated with the 1920s 

188
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,327
Both in America, mostly Chicago

189
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:26,193
And in China, mostly Shanghai

190
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,000
To Chinese people

191
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,588
Republic Era Shanghai is a paradox

192
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:32,961
It's often depicted with nostalgia

193
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:35,833
A place of glamourous high fashion

194
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:39,673
Yet, it is also remembered as a crime-ridden place

195
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:41,583
Where the mafia ruled the streets

196
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,478
Where wealth disparity went out of control

197
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,240
It's remembered as a place divided up by colonizers 

198
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,520
It's remembered as a place where war looms over

199
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,923
None of what I said is 100% historically accurate

200
00:08:55,923 --> 00:08:57,557
But that doesn't matter

201
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,851
Because to a general audience

202
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:02,302
Shanghai was PERCEIVED that way

203
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,871
And so, when Nezha Reborn takes on that aesthetic

204
00:09:05,871 --> 00:09:09,137
It also takes on that perception through association

205
00:09:09,137 --> 00:09:10,223
Crime

206
00:09:10,223 --> 00:09:12,036
Social inequality

207
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:12,853
War

208
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,240
This aesthetic is reinforced at every corner 

209
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,400
Nezha's brother looks exactly like a Republic Era cliche

210
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,240
The mafia is exactly how you remember it from Kung Fu Hustle

211
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,915
Even the text is written right to left

212
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:29,520
With era-appropriate fonts and styles

213
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,600
The details reinforce the sense of history and culture 

214
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,200
This history and culture, in turn, anchor the world 

215
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,400
Allowing the audience to relate to and feel the movie

216
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,480
It's only when all of that groundworks are done 

217
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
That Nezha Reborn can build the rest of its visual identity 

218
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,445
On top of this solid foundation

219
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:52,499
The steampunk technology

220
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:53,553
The fashion

221
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:54,833
The architecture

222
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,124
The less critical something is to the plot

223
00:09:57,124 --> 00:09:59,032
The more liberty can be taken

224
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,640
Nezha's spirit? 

225
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,887
Highly important

226
00:10:01,887 --> 00:10:03,347
Pretty traditional looking

227
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,059
A character referencing the Monkey King?

228
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:07,926
The association is strengthened

229
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:11,600
Through a related reference to his iconic Water Curtain Cave

230
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,227
The motorcycle?

231
00:10:13,227 --> 00:10:14,810
Barely a set dressing

232
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,750
Historical accuracy can take a backseat

233
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,915
This is how you reimagine an old story

234
00:10:20,915 --> 00:10:22,735
Keep the core of the story

235
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:24,929
Explore it from a different angle

236
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:29,084
Build a solid foundation through cultural and historical reference

237
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:33,020
And only add a sense of style as the icing on top

238
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,560
While it's often the outside appearance that gets praised 

239
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,258
Cliché as it may sound

240
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:41,584
It's always what's inside that matters

241
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:43,788
[Conclusion] 

242
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,031
I refrained from going very in-depth in this video

243
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:50,327
Because I don't want to spoil this movie

244
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,374
With all the context provided

245
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,443
I think you can now enjoy the film to its fullest

246
00:10:55,443 --> 00:10:58,336
Even if you are unfamiliar with Chinese mythology

247
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,261
But before we go 

248
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:04,273
I'd like to take a little bit more time to just admire this movie

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
There is a reason I brought up the 1979 Nezha animation 

250
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,726
Well, aside from it being what many people consider to be 

251
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:13,342
The definitive adaptation

252
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,647
There is this one sequence

253
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:18,898
In which Nezha's father, with a sword in hand

254
00:11:18,898 --> 00:11:22,033
Threatens to kill Nezha To restore order

255
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,838
And to appease the gods

256
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,080
It was a perplexing scene for a lot of children 

257
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,765
To me, and to everyone

258
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:31,760
Nezha did the right thing

259
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,077
He's helping the weak

260
00:11:33,077 --> 00:11:34,375
He's saving the people

261
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,434
But at the same time

262
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:38,537
Nezha is undeniably violent

263
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:41,853
Is pulling out his god d#mn spine really necessary?

264
00:11:42,206 --> 00:11:44,479
The film manages to teach children

265
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:47,212
The moral complexity in the adult world

266
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,120
This shocking moment 

267
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,196
Is one of the most remembered images in Chinese animation history

268
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,960
Nezha's death 

269
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,400
Makes us feel like something is unjust about the world 

270
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,479
A feeling that has only gotten more intense as we grow up

271
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,800
In Nezha Reborn 

272
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,803
The morality behind Nezha's violence is even more ambiguous

273
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,713
After the mafia robbery

274
00:12:10,713 --> 00:12:14,507
Nezha's little sister lost a leg in the crossfire

275
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,408
Seeing this Nezha's first reaction isn't to stay by her side

276
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:21,434
But to seek revenge

277
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,800
And so 

278
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,480
When the villains accuse Nezha of being a violent, destructive person

279
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,593
Imagine my shock

280
00:12:28,593 --> 00:12:30,767
When the movie shows me a scene

281
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:34,223
That directly referenced the 1979 classic

282
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:37,840
Faithfully recreated every single memorable image

283
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,543
Somehow

284
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:41,173
I don't really know how

285
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,080
The movie makes me feel like I'm watching the animation 

286
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,583
For the first time

287
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,511
Again

288
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,600
I'm faced with the same morality question 

289
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,044
But now, with even more complexity

290
00:12:52,044 --> 00:12:55,000
And I have to answer it as an adult

291
00:12:55,819 --> 00:12:58,720
Sadly, the film is not entirely successful 

292
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,229
The pace of the plot can be pretty messy

293
00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:03,974
Scene to scene transitions are sometimes jarring

294
00:13:03,974 --> 00:13:07,772
It's almost like parts of the movie are cut out or unfinished

295
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,280
Its own answer to the question  of violence and justice 

296
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,840
Is also not entirely satisfying 

297
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,040
The movie isn't as philosophical  as everyone have hoped

298
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,896
While these criticisms are certainly valid

299
00:13:20,896 --> 00:13:22,875
There is a silver lining

300
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,875
We are now at a point where merely "good" is not good enough

301
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,603
Chinese animation has gotten to a point

302
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:31,923
Where the audience has expectations

303
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:34,139
High expectations

304
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,200
In the past, I recommended Chinese animated films 

305
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,400
With the premise that it's good for a Chinese production

306
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,698
But, with this one...

307
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,405
This might be it

308
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:45,902
Chinese or not

309
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,925
This is just... good

310
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:50,778
You should watch it
